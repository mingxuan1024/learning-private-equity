在拿到项目BP，分析完商业模式之后，你应该有底气说出下面这6句话：

1. I understand the point of this company, I buy into its strategic narrative and I am convinced that its business needs to exist, now and in the future;
2. I became somewhat of a desktop expert on the industry structure and competitive dynamics;我在某种程度上已经成为这个行业在行业结构和竞争动态上的专家了
3. I can tell in my own words how the company makes money and understand the economics of its business model;我能用自己的话说出来这家公司是怎么赚钱的，理解它的商业模式
4. I know what operational improvements and growth initiatives will be pursued and accomplished during my investment horizon under the ownership of my fund;我知道在投资这家公司后，怎样帮助它提升提升盈利
5. I have a solid operating model and a set of financial projections that I am prepared to underwrite as my investment base case. Furthermore, I produced sensitivity analyses to cover upside and downside scenarios; and我有一个可靠的运营模式和一套财务预测，我准备将其作为我的投资基本案例。此外，我还进行了敏感性分析以涵盖上行和下行情景；
6. I identified a list of key assumptions that need to be verified and validated during the due diligence process, assuming the deal goes ahead.我确定了一系列关键假设，假设交易继续进行，则需要在尽职调查过程中进行验证和验证。



In every business plan analysis, I seek detailed answers to the following 10 questions:
1. What does this company do? Does it need to exist? What customer needs does it serve?
2. What macro factors are likely to affect this business during my investment horizon?
3. What do I need to know about the industry to put the company's business plan into context?
4. What are the key building blocks of this company's business
model?
5. How is this company positioned at present compared to its competitors?
6. What does the company do well now and what does it do badly?
7. How has this business done historically?
8. What 5-year projections am I underwriting as an investment base case? What are the key sources of value creation during my investment horizon?
9. What are the risks? What is my downside investment case?
10. Does my investment case add up?

1.这家公司是做什么的？它有必要存在吗？它满足什么客户需求？ 2. 在我的投资期内，哪些宏观因素可能会影响该业务？ 3. 我需要了解该行业的哪些信息才能将公司的业务计划融入到背景中？ 4. 该公司商业模式的关键组成部分是什么？ 5. 与竞争对手相比，该公司目前的定位如何？ 6、公司现在哪些方面做得好，哪些方面做得不好？ 7. 这项业务的历史表现如何？ 8. 作为投资基本案例，我将承保哪些 5 年预测？在我的投资期内，价值创造的主要来源是什么？ 9. 有哪些风险？我的下行投资理由是什么？ 10. 我的投资案例是否合理？
