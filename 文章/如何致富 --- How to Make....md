If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup. That's been a reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years. The word "startup" dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the Middle Ages.

如果你想致富，你会怎样做？我认为你最好的选择是创办或加入一家初创公司。数百年来，这一直是一种可靠的致富方式。 “初创公司”这个词可以追溯到 20 世纪 60 年代，但其中所发生的事情与中世纪风险投资支持的贸易航行非常相似。

**Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase "high-tech startup" is almost redundant. A startup is a small company that takes on a hard technical problem.**

**初创公司通常涉及技术，以至于“高科技初创公司”这个词几乎是多余的。初创公司是一家解决棘手技术问题的小公司。**

Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that. You don't have to know physics to be a good pitcher. But I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles. Why do startups have to be small? Will a startup inevitably stop being a startup as it grows larger? And why do they so often work on developing new technology? Why are there so many startups selling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil or laundry detergent?

许多人致富时只知道这一点。你不必了解物理学才能成为一名优秀的投手。但我认为它可以让你有优势理解基本原理。为什么初创公司必须规模较小？随着规模的扩大，初创公司是否会不可避免地不再是一家初创公司？为什么他们如此频繁地致力于开发新技术？为什么有这么多初创公司销售新药或计算机软件，却没有一家销售玉米油或洗衣粉？

**The Proposition 提案**

Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four. This pays especially well in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.

从经济角度来看，你可以将创业视为将你的整个工作生涯压缩为几年的一种方式。你不是低强度地工作四十年，而是尽可能努力地工作四年。这在技术领域的回报尤其丰厚，你可以因快速工作而获得溢价。

Here is a brief sketch of the economic proposition. If you're a good hacker in your mid twenties, you can get a job paying about $80,000 per year. So on average such a hacker must be able to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the company just to break even. You could probably work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if you focus you can probably get three times as much done in an hour.

\[1\] You should get another multiple of two, at least, by eliminating the drag of the pointy-haired middle manager who would be your boss in a big company. Then there is one more multiple: how much smarter are you than your job description expects you to be? Suppose another multiple of three. Combine all these multipliers, and I'm claiming you could be 36 times more productive than you're expected to be in a random corporate job. \[2\] If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a big company, then a smart hacker working very hard without any corporate bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about $3 million a year.这是经济主张的简要概述。如果你是一名二十多岁的优秀黑客，你可以找到一份年薪约 80,000 美元的工作。因此，平均而言，这样的黑客每年必须能够为公司完成至少价值 80,000 美元的工作才能实现收支平衡。你的工作时间可能是公司员工的两倍，如果你集中注意力，你可能在一小时内完成三倍的工作。 \[1\] 你至少应该再获得两倍的收益，通过消除尖头发的中层经理的拖累，他将成为你在大公司的老板。然后还有一个倍数：你比你的工作描述所期望的你聪明多少？假设还有一个三的倍数。将所有这些乘数结合起来，我声称您的工作效率可能比您在随机公司工作中预期的工作效率高出 36 倍。 \[2\] 如果一个相当优秀的黑客在一家大公司每年价值 80,000 美元，那么一个聪明的黑客在没有任何公司废话拖慢他的速度的情况下努力工作，应该能够完成每年价值约 300 万美元的工作。

Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one has a lot of wiggle room. I wouldn't try to defend the actual numbers. But I stand by the structure of the calculation. I'm not claiming the multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more than 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.

与所有粗略计算一样，这个计算有很大的回旋余地。我不会试图捍卫实际数字。但我坚持计算的结构。我并不是说乘数恰好是 36，但它肯定超过 10，并且可能很少高达 100。

If $3 million a year seems high, remember that we're talking about the limit case: the case where you not only have zero leisure time but indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.

如果每年 300 万美元看起来很高，请记住我们讨论的是极限情况：在这种情况下，您不仅休闲时间为零，而且确实工作非常努力，以至于危及健康。

Startups are not magic. They don't change the laws of wealth creation. They just represent a point at the far end of the curve. There is a conservation law at work here: if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars' worth of pain. For example, one way to make a million dollars would be to work for the Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your salary. Imagine the stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years. In a startup you compress all this stress into three or four years. You do tend to get a certain bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain, but you can't evade the fundamental conservation law. If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.

初创公司并不神奇。它们不会改变财富创造的法则。它们仅代表曲线远端的一个点。这里有一条守恒定律：如果你想赚一百万美元，你就必须忍受价值一百万美元的痛苦。例如，赚一百万美元的一种方法是一生为邮局工作，并节省每一分钱的薪水。想象一下在邮局工作五十年的压力。在初创公司中，你将所有这些压力压缩到三四年内。如果你购买经济型的痛苦，你确实往往会获得一定的批量折扣，但你无法逃避基本的守恒定律。如果创业很容易，那么每个人都会这样做。

**Millions, not Billions 数百万，而不是数十亿**

If $3 million a year seems high to some people, it will seem low to others. Three _million?_ How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?

如果每年 300 万美元对某些人来说似乎很高，那么对其他人来说则可能很低。三百万？我怎样才能像比尔·盖茨一样成为亿万富翁？

So let's get Bill Gates out of the way right now. It's not a good idea to use famous rich people as examples, because the press only write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers. Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man, but you need more than that to make as much money as he has. You also need to be very lucky.

所以现在让我们把比尔·盖茨排除在外。用著名的富人作为例子并不是一个好主意，因为媒体只报道最富有的人，而这些人往往是异常值。比尔·盖茨是一个聪明、坚定、勤奋的人，但你需要的不仅仅是这些才能赚到像他一样多的钱。你还需要非常幸运。

There is a large random factor in the success of any company. So the guys you end up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very smart, totally dedicated, _and_ win the lottery. Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for DOS. No doubt Bill did everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if there had been one person with a brain on IBM's side, Microsoft's future would have been very different. Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM. They were effectively a component supplier. If IBM had required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft would still have signed the deal. It would still have meant a lot of money for them, and IBM could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.

任何公司的成功都存在很大的随机因素。所以你最终在报纸上读到的人都是那些非常聪明、完全奉献并且赢得彩票的人。当然，比尔聪明又专注，但微软也恰好是商业史上最重大错误之一的受益者：DOS 许可交易。毫无疑问，比尔竭尽全力引导 IBM 犯下这个错误，而且他在利用这一错误方面做得非常出色，但如果 IBM 这边有一个有头脑的人，微软的未来将会大不相同。在那个阶段，微软对 IBM 的影响力微乎其微。他们实际上是零部件供应商。如果 IBM 要求独家许可（他们应该这样做），那么微软仍然会签署该协议。这对他们来说仍然意味着很多钱，而且 IBM 可以很容易地在其他地方获得操作系统。

Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market to give Microsoft control of the PC standard. From that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute. They never had to bet the company on a bold decision. All they had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more innovative products reasonably promptly.

相反，IBM 最终利用其在市场上的全部力量让微软控制了 PC 标准。从那时起，微软所要做的就是执行。他们从来不需要把公司的赌注押在一个大胆的决定上。他们所要做的就是对被许可人采取强硬态度，并及时合理地复制更多创新产品。

If IBM hadn't made this mistake, Microsoft would still have been a successful company, but it could not have grown so big so fast. Bill Gates would be rich, but he'd be somewhere near the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.

如果IBM没有犯这个错误，微软仍然会是一家成功的公司，但它不可能发展得这么大这么快。比尔·盖茨会很富有，但与其他同龄人相比，他在福布斯 400 强中排名接近垫底。

There are a lot of ways to get rich, and this essay is about only one of them. This essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and getting paid for it. There are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying, counterfeiting, and prospecting. Most of the greatest fortunes have probably involved several of these.

致富的方法有很多，本文仅讨论其中一种。这篇文章是关于如何通过创造财富并获得报酬来赚钱。赚钱的方式还有很多，包括机会、投机、婚姻、继承、盗窃、勒索、欺诈、垄断、贪污、游说、伪造和探矿。大多数最大的财富可能都涉及其中的几个。

The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich, is not just that it's more legitimate (many of the other methods are now illegal) but that it's more _straightforward._ You just have to do something people want.

创造财富作为一种致富方式的优势不仅在于它更合法（许多其他方法现在都是非法的），而且更简单。你只需要做人们想要的事情。

**Money Is Not Wealth 金钱不是财富**

If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is. Wealth is not the same thing as money.

\[3\] Wealth is as old as human history. Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. Money is a comparatively recent invention.如果你想创造财富，了解它是什么会有所帮助。财富与金钱不同。 \[3\] 财富与人类历史一样古老。事实上，他的年龄要大得多。蚂蚁有财富。货币是一项相对较新的发明。

Wealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. If you had a magic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn't need money. Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is nothing to buy, it wouldn't matter how much money you had.

财富是根本。财富是我们想要的东西：食物、衣服、房子、汽车、小玩意、去有趣的地方旅行等等。没有钱也可以拥有财富。如果你有一台神奇的机器，可以根据命令为你制造汽车、为你做饭、洗衣服或做任何你想做的事情，那么你就不需要钱了。但如果你在南极洲中部，那里没有东西可买，那么你有多少钱也无济于事。

Wealth is what you want, not money. But if wealth is the important thing, why does everyone talk about making money? It is a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice they are usually interchangeable. But they are not the same thing, and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about _making money_ can make it harder to understand how to make money.

你想要的是财富，而不是金钱。但如果财富才是最重要的，那为什么大家都在谈论赚钱呢？这是一种简写：金钱是转移财富的一种方式，在实践中它们通常是可以互换的。但它们不是一回事，除非你打算通过造假致富，否则谈论赚钱会让你更难理解如何赚钱。

Money is a side effect of specialization. In a specialized society, most of the things you need, you can't make for yourself. If you want a potato or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone else.

金钱是专业化的副作用。在一个专业化的社会里，你需要的大部分东西，你都无法自己制造。如果你想要一个土豆、一支铅笔或者一个住的地方，你就必须从别人那里得到。

How do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some? By giving him something he wants in return. But you can't get very far by trading things directly with the people who need them. If you make violins, and none of the local farmers wants one, how will you eat?

如何让种土豆的人给你一些？通过给他一些他想要的回报。但直接与需要物品的人进行交易是不可能走得太远的。如果你制作小提琴，而当地农民都不想要一把，你怎么吃？

The solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is to make the trade into a two-step process. Instead of trading violins directly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver, which you can then trade again for anything else you need. The intermediate stuff-- the _medium of exchange_\-- can be anything that's rare and portable. Historically metals have been the most common, but recently we've been using a medium of exchange, called the _dollar_, that doesn't physically exist. It works as a medium of exchange, however, because its rarity is guaranteed by the U.S. Government.

随着社会变得更加专业化，他们发现的解决方案是将贸易分为两步。您不是直接用小提琴换取土豆，而是用小提琴换取白银，然后您可以再次用白银换取您需要的任何其他东西。中间物质——交换媒介——可以是任何稀有且便携的东西。从历史上看，金属是最常见的，但最近我们一直在使用一种称为美元的交换媒介，但它实际上并不存在。然而，它可以作为一种交换媒介，因为它的稀有性是由美国政府保证的。

The advantage of a medium of exchange is that it makes trade work. The disadvantage is that it tends to obscure what trade really means. People think that what a business does is make money. But money is just the intermediate stage-- just a shorthand-- for whatever people want. What most businesses really do is make wealth. They do something people want.

\[4\]交换媒介的优势在于它使贸易得以进行。缺点是它往往会掩盖贸易的真正含义。人们认为企业所做的就是赚钱。但金钱只是人们想要的任何东西的中间阶段——只是一个简写。大多数企业真正做的就是创造财富。他们做人们想要的事情。 \[4\]

**The Pie Fallacy 馅饼谬误**

A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world. There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of _money_ at any moment. But that's not the same thing.

数量惊人的人从小就保留着世界上财富是固定数量的观念。在任何正常的家庭中，任何时候都有固定数额的钱。但这不是一回事。

When wealth is talked about in this context, it is often described as a pie. "You can't make the pie larger," say politicians. When you're talking about the amount of money in one family's bank account, or the amount available to a government from one year's tax revenue, this is true. If one person gets more, someone else has to get less.

当在这种情况下谈论财富时，它通常被描述为一块馅饼。 “你不能把蛋糕做大，”政客们说。当您谈论一个家庭银行帐户中的金额或政府一年税收收入中可用的金额时，这是事实。如果一个人得到更多，其他人就必须得到更少。

I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else. Many people seem to continue to believe something like this well into adulthood. This fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how x percent of the population have y percent of the wealth. If you plan to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you're planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.

我记得小时候我相信，如果少数富人拥有了所有的钱，那么留给其他人的钱就会更少。许多人似乎一直相信这样的事情直到成年。当你听到有人谈论 x% 的人口如何拥有 y% 的财富时，这种谬论通常就存在。如果你打算创办一家初创公司，那么无论你是否意识到，你都在计划反驳馅饼谬误。

What leads people astray here is the abstraction of money. Money is not wealth. It's just something we use to move wealth around. So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to trade with other people for things you want, there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world. _You can make more wealth._ Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.

这里使人们误入歧途的是金钱的抽象。金钱不是财富。它只是我们用来转移财富的东西。因此，尽管在某些特定时刻（比如本月你的家人）可能有固定数量的资金可用于与其他人交易你想要的东西，但世界上并没有固定数量的财富。你可以创造更多的财富。在整个人类历史中，财富一直在被创造和毁灭（但总的来说，是被创造的）。

Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt next summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In doing so you create wealth. The world is-- and you specifically are-- one pristine old car the richer. And not just in some metaphorical way. If you sell your car, you'll get more for it.

假设您拥有一辆破旧的旧车。您不必在明年夏天坐以待毙，而是可以花时间将您的汽车恢复到原始状态。通过这样做，您创造了财富。世界——尤其是你——一辆原始的旧车更富有。而且不仅仅是以某种隐喻的方式。如果你卖掉你的车，你会得到更多。

In restoring your old car you have made yourself richer. You haven't made anyone else poorer. So there is obviously not a fixed pie. And in fact, when you look at it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was.

\[5\]通过修复你的旧车，你让自己变得更加富有。你没有让其他人变得更穷。所以显然没有一个固定的馅饼。事实上，当你这样看时，你会想知道为什么有人会认为存在。 \[5\]

Kids know, without knowing they know, that they can create wealth. If you need to give someone a present and don't have any money, you make one. But kids are so bad at making things that they consider home-made presents to be a distinct, inferior, sort of thing to store-bought ones-- a mere expression of the proverbial thought that counts. And indeed, the lumpy ashtrays we made for our parents did not have much of a resale market.

孩子们知道，尽管他们不知道自己知道，他们可以创造财富。如果你需要送某人一份礼物但又没有钱，你就可以制作一份。但孩子们不擅长制作东西，以至于他们认为自制的礼物与商店购买的礼物相比是一种独特的、低劣的东西——这只是众所周知的重要思想的表达。事实上，我们为父母制作的块状烟灰缸并没有太大的转售市场。

**Craftsmen 工匠**

The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen. Their hand-made objects become store-bought ones. But with the rise of industrialization there are fewer and fewer craftsmen. One of the biggest remaining groups is computer programmers.

最有可能认识到财富是可以创造的人是那些善于制造东西的人，即工匠。他们的手工制品变成了商店里买的东西。但随着工业化的兴起，工匠越来越少。剩下的最大群体之一是计算机程序员。

A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and _create wealth_. A good piece of software is, in itself, a valuable thing. There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue. Those characters you type are a complete, finished product. If someone sat down and wrote a web browser that didn't suck (a fine idea, by the way), the world would be that much richer.

\[5b\]程序员可以坐在电脑前创造财富。一款好的软件本身就是一件有价值的事情。没有制造来混淆这个问题。您输入的这些字符是一个完整的成品。如果有人坐下来编写一个不那么糟糕的网络浏览器（顺便说一下，这是一个好主意），世界将会变得更加丰富。 \[5b\]

Everyone in a company works together to create wealth, in the sense of making more things people want. Many of the employees (e.g. the people in the mailroom or the personnel department) work at one remove from the actual making of stuff. Not the programmers. They literally think the product, one line at a time. And so it's clearer to programmers that wealth is something that's made, rather than being distributed, like slices of a pie, by some imaginary Daddy.

公司中的每个人都共同努力创造财富，即制造更多人们想要的东西。许多员工（例如收发室或人事部门的人员）都远离实际的产品制作。不是程序员。他们从字面上理解产品，一次一行。因此，对于程序员来说，更清楚的是，财富是由某个想象中的爸爸创造出来的，而不是像馅饼一样被分配的。

It's also obvious to programmers that there are huge variations in the rate at which wealth is created. At Viaweb we had one programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity. I remember watching what he did one long day and estimating that he had added several hundred thousand dollars to the market value of the company. A great programmer, on a roll, could create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks. A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).

对于程序员来说，显而易见的是，财富创造的速度存在巨大差异。在 Viaweb，我们有一位程序员，他的生产力堪称怪物。我记得观察了他一整天的所作所为，估计他为公司的市值增加了数十万美元。一个出色的程序员可以在几周内创造价值一百万美元的财富。同一时期的平庸程序员将产生零财富甚至负财富（例如通过引入错误）。

This is why so many of the best programmers are libertarians. In our world, you sink or swim, and there are no excuses. When those far removed from the creation of wealth-- undergraduates, reporters, politicians-- hear that the richest 5% of the people have half the total wealth, they tend to think _injustice!_ An experienced programmer would be more likely to think _is that all?_ The top 5% of programmers probably write 99% of the good software.

这就是为什么这么多最好的程序员都是自由主义者。在我们的世界里，你要么沉要么游，没有任何借口。当那些远离财富创造的人——大学生、记者、政客——听到最富有的5%的人拥有总财富的一半时，他们往往会认为不公平！经验丰富的程序员更有可能认为这就是全部了？前 5% 的程序员可能编写出 99% 的好软件。

Wealth can be created without being sold. Scientists, till recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they created. We are all richer for knowing about penicillin, because we're less likely to die from infections. Wealth is whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something we want. Hackers often donate their work by writing open source software that anyone can use for free. I am much the richer for the operating system FreeBSD, which I'm running on the computer I'm using now, and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.

财富无需出售即可创造。至少直到最近，科学家们仍然有效地捐赠了他们创造的财富。我们因了解青霉素而变得更加富有，因为我们死于感染的可能性较小。财富是人们想要的，不死当然是我们想要的。黑客经常通过编写任何人都可以免费使用的开源软件来捐赠他们的工作。我对 FreeBSD 操作系统更感兴趣，我现在使用的计算机上运行着它，雅虎也是如此，它在他们所有的服务器上运行着它。

**What a Job Is 什么是工作**

In industrialized countries, people belong to one institution or another at least until their twenties. After all those years you get used to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get up in the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing. Belonging to such a group becomes part of your identity: name, age, role, institution. If you have to introduce yourself, or someone else describes you, it will be as something like, John Smith, age 10, a student at such and such elementary school, or John Smith, age 20, a student at such and such college.

在工业化国家，人们至少在二十几岁时就属于一个或另一个机构。这么多年过去了，你已经习惯了属于一群人，他们早上起床，去一些建筑物，做他们通常不喜欢做的事情。属于这样一个群体成为你身份的一部分：姓名、年龄、角色、机构。如果你必须自我介绍，或者别人描述你，就会这样说：约翰·史密斯，10 岁，某某小学的学生，或者约翰·史密斯，20 岁，某某大学的学生。

When John Smith finishes school he is expected to get a job. And what getting a job seems to mean is joining another institution. Superficially it's a lot like college. You pick the companies you want to work for and apply to join them. If one likes you, you become a member of this new group. You get up in the morning and go to a new set of buildings, and do things that you do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing. There are a few differences: life is not as much fun, and you get paid, instead of paying, as you did in college. But the similarities feel greater than the differences. John Smith is now John Smith, 22, a software developer at such and such corporation.

当约翰·史密斯完成学业后，他预计会找到一份工作。找到一份工作似乎意味着加入另一家机构。从表面上看，这很像大学。您选择想要工作的公司并申请加入他们。如果有人喜欢你，你就会成为这个新群体的一员。你早上起床，去一组新的建筑，做一些你平时不喜欢做的事情。有一些区别：生活没有那么有趣，你得到报酬，而不是像在大学时那样付钱。但相似之处大于差异。约翰·史密斯 (John Smith) 现在是约翰·史密斯 (John Smith)，22 岁，在某某公司担任软件开发人员。

In fact John Smith's life has changed more than he realizes. Socially, a company looks much like college, but the deeper you go into the underlying reality, the more different it gets.

事实上，约翰·史密斯的生活发生的变化比他意识到的要大。从社会角度来看，一家公司看起来很像大学，但你越深入了解潜在的现实，它就会变得越不同。

What a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue to exist, is earn money. And the way most companies make money is by creating wealth. Companies can be so specialized that this similarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing companies that create wealth. A big component of wealth is location. Remember that magic machine that could make you cars and cook you dinner and so on? It would not be so useful if it delivered your dinner to a random location in central Asia. If wealth means what people want, companies that move things also create wealth. Ditto for many other kinds of companies that don't make anything physical. Nearly all companies exist to do something people want.

一个公司所做的，并且如果它想继续存在就必须做的就是赚钱。大多数公司赚钱的方式是创造财富。公司的专业化程度可能很高，以至于这种相似性被掩盖了，但创造财富的不仅仅是制造公司。财富的一个重要组成部分是位置。还记得那个可以为你制造汽车、为你做饭等的神奇机器吗？如果它把你的晚餐送到中亚的一个随机地点，那就没有那么有用了。如果财富意味着人们想要的，那么搬运物品的公司也会创造财富。对于许多其他类型的不生产任何实体产品的公司来说也是如此。几乎所有公司的存在都是为了做人们想要的事情。

And that's what you do, as well, when you go to work for a company. But here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlying reality. In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other people's. You may not even be aware you're doing something people want. Your contribution may be indirect. But the company as a whole must be giving people something they want, or they won't make any money. And if they are paying you x dollars a year, then on average you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth of work, or the company will be spending more than it makes, and will go out of business.

当你去一家公司工作时，这也是你所做的。但这里还有另一层往往会掩盖潜在的现实。在公司里，你所做的工作是与许多其他人一起平均完成的。您甚至可能没有意识到您正在做人们想要的事情。您的贡献可能是间接的。但公司作为一个整体必须给人们提供他们想要的东西，否则他们就赚不到钱。如果他们每年付给你 x 美元，那么平均而言，你每年必须贡献至少 x 美元的工作价值，否则公司将支出超过其收入，并会倒闭。

Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs to get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of an institution. A more direct way to put it would be: you need to start doing something people want. You don't need to join a company to do that. All a company is is a group of people working together to do something people want. It's doing something people want that matters, not joining the group.

\[6\]大学毕业的人认为，并且被告知，他需要找到一份工作，就好像重要的是成为一个机构的成员一样。更直接的说法是：你需要开始做人们想要的事情。您不需要加入公司即可做到这一点。公司就是一群人一起工作，做人们想做的事情。重要的是做人们想要的事情，而不是加入这个团体。 \[6\]

For most people the best plan probably is to go to work for some existing company. But it is a good idea to understand what's happening when you do this. A job means doing something people want, averaged together with everyone else in that company.

对于大多数人来说，最好的计划可能是去一些现有的公司工作。但最好了解执行此操作时发生的情况。工作意味着做人们想要的事情，并与公司中的其他人一起平均。

**Working Harder 更加努力地工作**

That averaging gets to be a problem. I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the difficulty of assigning a value to each person's work. For the most part they punt. In a big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working fairly hard. You're expected not to be obviously incompetent or lazy, but you're not expected to devote your whole life to your work.

平均化会成为一个问题。我认为困扰大公司的最大问题是难以为每个人的工作分配价值。大多数情况下，他们都是投注。在一家大公司，你工作相当努力，就会得到相当可预测的薪水。人们不希望你表现得明显无能或懒惰，但也不希望你将一生都奉献给你的工作。

It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your life you devote to your work. In the right kind of business, someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or even a hundred times as much wealth as an average employee. A programmer, for example, instead of chugging along maintaining and updating an existing piece of software, could write a whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source of revenue.

但事实证明，你将一生的时间投入到工作中，存在着规模经济。在正确的行业中，真正投入工作的人可以创造比普通员工十倍甚至一百倍的财富。例如，程序员可以编写一个全新的软件，并以此创造新的收入来源，而不是费力地维护和更新现有的软件。

Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this. You can't go to your boss and say, I'd like to start working ten times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? For one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as hard as you can. But a more serious problem is that the company has no way of measuring the value of your work.

公司的设立并不是为了奖励那些愿意这样做的人。你不能去找你的老板说，我想开始十倍努力地工作，所以你能付给我十倍的工资吗？一方面，官方的说法是你已经在尽你所能地努力工作。但更严重的问题是，公司没有办法衡量你的工作价值。

Salesmen are an exception. It's easy to measure how much revenue they generate, and they're usually paid a percentage of it. If a salesman wants to work harder, he can just start doing it, and he will automatically get paid proportionally more.

推销员是个例外。衡量他们产生的收入很容易，而且他们通常会获得一定比例的报酬。如果一个推销员想更加努力地工作，他就可以开始做，他会自动按比例获得更多的报酬。

There is one other job besides sales where big companies can hire first-rate people: in the top management jobs. And for the same reason: their performance can be measured. The top managers are held responsible for the performance of the entire company. Because an ordinary employee's performance can't usually be measured, he is not expected to do more than put in a solid effort. Whereas top management, like salespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers. The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in a solid effort. If the company does badly, he's done badly.

除了销售之外，大公司还可以雇佣一流的人才，那就是高层管理职位。出于同样的原因：他们的表现是可以衡量的。高层管理人员对整个公司的绩效负责。由于普通员工的绩效通常无法衡量，因此他除了付出扎实的努力外，不会做更多的事情。而高层管理人员，如销售人员，必须实际拿出数字。一家陷入困境的公司的首席执行官不能辩称他付出了坚实的努力。如果公司做得不好，他也做得不好。

A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly would be enormously successful. Many employees would work harder if they could get paid for it. More importantly, such a company would attract people who wanted to work especially hard. It would crush its competitors.

一家能够如此直接地向所有员工支付工资的公司将会取得巨大的成功。如果能够获得报酬，许多员工会更加努力地工作。更重要的是，这样的公司会吸引那些想特别努力工作的人。它将碾压其竞争对手。

Unfortunately, companies can't pay everyone like salesmen. Salesmen work alone. Most employees' work is tangled together. Suppose a company makes some kind of consumer gadget. The engineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features; the industrial designers design a beautiful case for it; and then the marketing people convince everyone that it's something they've got to have. How do you know how much of the gadget's sales are due to each group's efforts? Or, for that matter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that gave the company a reputation for quality? There's no way to untangle all their contributions. Even if you could read the minds of the consumers, you'd find these factors were all blurred together.

不幸的是，公司不能像推销员一样向每个人支付工资。推销员单独工作。大多数员工的工作都是纠缠在一起的。假设一家公司生产某种消费电子产品。工程师们打造了一款具有各种新功能的可靠小工具；工业设计师为它设计了一个漂亮的外壳；然后营销人员让每个人都相信这是他们必须拥有的东西。您如何知道该小工具的销售额有多少归功于每个团队的努力？或者，就此而言，过去的小玩意的创造者为该公司赢得了质量声誉，这在多大程度上归功于他们？没有办法理清他们所有的贡献。即使你能读懂消费者的想法，你也会发现这些因素都模糊在一起了。

If you want to go faster, it's a problem to have your work tangled together with a large number of other people's. In a large group, your performance is not separately measurable-- and the rest of the group slows you down.

如果你想走得更快，你的工作和大量其他人的工作纠缠在一起是一个问题。在一个大团体中，你的表现是无法单独衡量的——而团体中的其他人会拖慢你的速度。

**Measurement and Leverage**

To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.

为了致富，你需要让自己处于一个拥有两件事的境地：衡量和杠杆。你需要处于一个可以衡量你的表现的位置，否则就没有办法通过做更多的事情来获得更多的报酬。而且你必须有影响力，因为你所做的决定会产生很大的影响。

Measurement alone is not enough. An example of a job with measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a sweatshop. Your performance is measured and you get paid accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions. The only decision you get to make is how fast you work, and that can probably only increase your earnings by a factor of two or three.

仅仅测量是不够的。一个有衡量标准但没有影响力的工作的例子是在血汗工厂做计件工作。你的表现会受到衡量，你也会得到相应的报酬，但你没有决策的余地。你要做的唯一决定就是你的工作速度，而这可能只会让你的收入增加两到三倍。

An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would be lead actor in a movie. Your performance can be measured in the gross of the movie. And you have leverage in the sense that your performance can make or break it.

电影中的主角就是兼具衡量和影响力的工作的一个例子。你的表现可以用电影的总票房来衡量。从某种意义上说，你具有影响力，你的表现可以决定成败。

CEOs also have both measurement and leverage. They're measured, in that the performance of the company is their performance. And they have leverage in that their decisions set the whole company moving in one direction or another.

首席执行官也有衡量标准和影响力。他们是经过衡量的，因为公司的绩效就是他们的绩效。他们具有影响力，因为他们的决策使整个公司朝着一个方向或另一个方向发展。

I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, hedge fund managers, professional athletes. A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure. Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying possibility of loss. CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes all live with the sword hanging over their heads; the moment they start to suck, they're out. If you're in a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.

我想，每个靠自己努力致富的人，都会发现自己处在一个有衡量、有杠杆的境地。我能想到的每个人都这样做：首席执行官、电影明星、对冲基金经理、职业运动员。失败的可能性是杠杆存在的一个很好的暗示。上行必须与下行相平衡，因此，如果有巨大的获利潜力，也必然存在可怕的损失可能性。首席执行官、明星、基金经理和运动员都生活在头顶上的剑；一旦他们开始糟糕，他们就出局了。如果你从事的工作感觉安全，你就不会致富，因为如果没有危险，几乎肯定没有杠杆作用。

But you don't have to become a CEO or a movie star to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. All you need to do is be part of a small group working on a hard problem.

但你不必成为首席执行官或电影明星才能处于具有衡量和影响力的境地。您所需要做的就是成为解决难题的小组的一员。

**Smallness = Measurement 小=测量**

If you can't measure the value of the work done by individual employees, you can get close. You can measure the value of the work done by small groups.

如果您无法衡量单个员工所做工作的价值，您可以接近。您可以衡量小组所做工作的价值。

One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue generated by employees is at the level of the whole company. When the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to measuring the contributions of individual employees. A viable startup might only have ten employees, which puts you within a factor of ten of measuring individual effort.

您可以准确衡量员工产生的收入的一个级别是整个公司的级别。当公司规模较小时，您可以相当接近地衡量单个员工的贡献。一家可行的初创公司可能只有十名员工，这使您衡量个人努力的程度在十倍之内。

Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most people can get to saying to one's boss, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times as much. There are two differences: you're not saying it to your boss, but directly to the customers (for whom your boss is only a proxy after all), and you're not doing it individually, but along with a small group of other ambitious people.

因此，创办或加入一家初创公司就像大多数人对老板说的那样：我想加倍努力工作，所以请付给我十倍的工资。有两个区别：你不是对你的老板说，而是直接对客户说（你的老板毕竟只是他们的代理人），而且你不是单独做，而是与一小群其他人一起做。有野心的人。

It will, ordinarily, be a group. Except in a few unusual kinds of work, like acting or writing books, you can't be a company of one person. And the people you work with had better be good, because it's their work that yours is going to be averaged with.

通常，它将是一个团体。除了一些不寻常的工作，比如表演或写书，你不可能成为一个人的公司。和你一起工作的人最好是优秀的，因为他们的工作将与你的工作进行平均。

A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers. Two things keep the speed of the galley down. One is that individual rowers don't see any result from working harder. The other is that, in a group of a thousand people, the average rower is likely to be pretty average.

一家大公司就像一艘由一千名桨手驾驶的巨型厨房。有两件事降低了厨房的速度。一是个别赛艇运动员看不到更努力的工作带来的任何结果。另一个是，在一千人的团体中，划船者的平均水平可能相当平均。

If you took ten people at random out of the big galley and put them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go faster. They would have both carrot and stick to motivate them. An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thought that he could have a visible effect on the speed of the boat. And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely to notice and complain.

如果你从大厨房里随机带十个人，把他们单独放到一条船上，他们可能会走得更快。他们会用胡萝卜加大棒来激励他们。一个精力充沛的划船者会因为他可以对船的速度产生明显的影响而感到鼓舞。如果有人懒惰，其他人就更有可能注意到并抱怨。

But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when you take the ten _best_ rowers out of the big galley and put them in a boat together. They will have all the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group. But more importantly, by selecting that small a group you can get the best rowers. Each one will be in the top 1%. It's a much better deal for them to average their work together with a small group of their peers than to average it with everyone.

但当你把十名最好的划手从大厨房里拿出来并把他们放在一条船上时，十人船的真正优势就显现出来了。他们将获得来自小组的所有额外动力。但更重要的是，通过选择这个小团体，您可以获得最好的赛艇运动员。每一位都将跻身前1%。对他们来说，与一小群同事一起平均工作比与所有人平均工作要好得多。

That's the real point of startups. Ideally, you are getting together with a group of other people who also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in a big company. And because startups tend to get founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already know one another (at least by reputation), the level of measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone. A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.

这就是初创公司的真正意义所在。理想情况下，你和一群其他人在一起，他们也想比在大公司更努力地工作，并获得更多的报酬。而且由于初创公司往往是由一群雄心勃勃的人自行选择成立的，这些人已经彼此认识（至少是通过声誉），因此衡量水平比仅从规模小中获得的衡量水平更加精确。一家初创公司不仅仅是十个人，而是十个像你这样的人。

Steve Jobs once said that the success or failure of a startup depends on the first ten employees. I agree. If anything, it's more like the first five. Being small is not, in itself, what makes startups kick butt, but rather that small groups can be select. You don't want small in the sense of a village, but small in the sense of an all-star team.

史蒂夫·乔布斯曾经说过，创业公司的成败取决于最初的十名员工。我同意。如果有的话，它更像是前五个。规模小本身并不是初创公司成功的原因，而是可以选择小群体。你想要的不是村庄意义上的小，而是全明星球队意义上的小。

The larger a group, the closer its average member will be to the average for the population as a whole. So all other things being equal, a very able person in a big company is probably getting a bad deal, because his performance is dragged down by the overall lower performance of the others. Of course, all other things often are not equal: the able person may not care about money, or may prefer the stability of a large company. But a very able person who does care about money will ordinarily do better to go off and work with a small group of peers.

群体越大，其平均成员就越接近整个人口的平均水平。因此，在所有其他条件相同的情况下，大公司中一个非常有能力的人可能会得到一笔糟糕的交易，因为他的绩效受到其他人整体较低绩效的拖累。当然，其他所有事情往往并不相同：有能力的人可能不关心金钱，或者可能更喜欢大公司的稳定性。但是，一个真正关心金钱的非常有能力的人通常会更好地与一小群同事一起工作。

**Technology = Leverage**

Startups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. They allow measurement because they're small, and they offer leverage because they make money by inventing new technology.

初创公司为任何人提供了一种具有衡量和影响力的方式。它们允许衡量，因为它们很小，它们提供杠杆，因为它们通过发明新技术赚钱。

What is technology? It's _technique_. It's the way we all do things. And when you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied by all the people who use it. It is the proverbial fishing rod, rather than the fish. That's the difference between a startup and a restaurant or a barber shop. You fry eggs or cut hair one customer at a time. Whereas if you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution. That's leverage.

什么是科技？这是技术。这是我们做事的方式。当你发现一种新的做事方式时，它的价值会因所有使用它的人而倍增。这是众所周知的钓鱼竿，而不是鱼。这就是初创公司和餐馆或理发店之间的区别。您一次为一位顾客煎鸡蛋或理发。然而，如果您解决了很多人关心的技术问题，那么您就帮助了所有使用您的解决方案的人。这就是杠杆。

If you look at history, it seems that most people who got rich by creating wealth did it by developing new technology. You just can't fry eggs or cut hair fast enough. What made the Florentines rich in 1200 was the discovery of new techniques for making the high-tech product of the time, fine woven cloth. What made the Dutch rich in 1600 was the discovery of shipbuilding and navigation techniques that enabled them to dominate the seas of the Far East.

如果你回顾历史，似乎大多数通过创造财富致富的人都是通过开发新技术来实现的。你就是无法足够快地煎鸡蛋或剪头发。 1200年，佛罗伦萨人之所以致富，是因为发现了制造当时高科技产品——细织布的新技术。 1600年，荷兰人之所以致富，是因为发现了造船和航海技术，使他们能够主宰远东海域。

Fortunately there is a natural fit between smallness and solving hard problems. The leading edge of technology moves fast. Technology that's valuable today could be worthless in a couple years. Small companies are more at home in this world, because they don't have layers of bureaucracy to slow them down. Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches, and small companies are less constrained by convention.

幸运的是，小规模和解决难题之间有着天然的契合点。技术的前沿发展迅速。今天有价值的技术可能在几年后变得一文不值。小公司在这个世界上更自在，因为它们没有层层官僚机构来拖慢它们的速度。此外，技术进步往往来自非正统的方法，而小公司受惯例的限制较少。

Big companies can develop technology. They just can't do it quickly. Their size makes them slow and prevents them from rewarding employees for the extraordinary effort required. So in practice big companies only get to develop technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups from competing with them, like microprocessors, power plants, or passenger aircraft. And even in those fields they depend heavily on startups for components and ideas.

大公司可以开发技术。他们只是不能很快做到。它们的规模使得它们行动缓慢，并且无法奖励员工所付出的非凡努力。因此，在实践中，大公司只能在巨额资本需求阻止初创公司与其竞争的领域开发技术，例如微处理器、发电厂或客机。即使在这些领域，他们也严重依赖初创公司提供组件和创意。

It's obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solve hard technical problems, but I think it will also be found to be true in businesses that don't seem to be about technology. McDonald's, for example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald's franchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the face of the earth. A McDonald's franchise is controlled by rules so precise that it is practically a piece of software. Write once, run everywhere. Ditto for Wal-Mart. Sam Walton got rich not by being a retailer, but by designing a new kind of store.

显然，生物技术或软件初创公司的存在是为了解决技术难题，但我认为在那些似乎与技术无关的企业中也会发现这一点。例如，麦当劳通过设计一种系统（麦当劳特许经营权）而发展壮大，然后可以在地球表面随意复制该系统。麦当劳的特许经营权受到如此精确的规则控制，以至于它实际上是一个软件。编写一次，到处运行。沃尔玛也是如此。山姆·沃尔顿致富不是通过成为零售商，而是通过设计一种新型商店。

Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way. At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was _run upstairs._ Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big, fat, bully. You open a door and find yourself in a staircase. Do you go up or down? I say up. The bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can. Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage. Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.

不仅在选择公司的总体目标时，而且在整个过程中的决策点上，都以困难为指导。在 Viaweb，我们的经验法则之一是在楼上执行。假设你是一个敏捷的小家伙，正在被一个又大又胖的恶霸追赶。你打开一扇门，发现自己在楼梯上。你是往上走还是往下走？我说起来。恶霸可能会像你一样快地跑下楼。上楼时，他的块头会更加不利。跑上楼对你来说很难，但对他来说更难。

What this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought hard problems. If there were two features we could add to our software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty, we'd always take the harder one. Not just because it was more valuable, but _because it was harder._ We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors to follow us over difficult ground. Like guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the mountains, where the troops of the central government can't follow. I can remember times when we were just exhausted after wrestling all day with some horrible technical problem. And I'd be delighted, because something that was hard for us would be impossible for our competitors.

这在实践中意味着我们有意识地寻找难题。如果我们可以在软件中添加两项功能，并且两者的价值与其难度成正比，那么我们总是会选择较难的一项。不仅因为它更有价值，而且因为它更难。我们很高兴能够迫使更大、更慢的竞争对手跟随我们走过困难的道路。就像游击队一样，初创公司更喜欢山区的险峻地形，中央政府的军队无法跟上。我记得有几次，我们在与一些可怕的技术问题搏斗一整天后感到筋疲力尽。我会很高兴，因为对我们来说困难的事情对我们的竞争对手来说是不可能的。

This is not just a good way to run a startup. It's what a startup is. Venture capitalists know about this and have a phrase for it: _barriers to entry._ If you go to a VC with a new idea and ask him to invest in it, one of the first things he'll ask is, how hard would this be for someone else to develop? That is, how much difficult ground have you put between yourself and potential pursuers?

\[7\] And you had better have a convincing explanation of why your technology would be hard to duplicate. Otherwise as soon as some big company becomes aware of it, they'll make their own, and with their brand name, capital, and distribution clout, they'll take away your market overnight. You'd be like guerillas caught in the open field by regular army forces.这不仅仅是经营一家初创公司的好方法。这就是初创公司。风险投资家知道这一点，并有一个词来形容它：进入壁垒。如果你带着一个新想法去找风投并要求他投资，他会问的第一件事就是，这对其他人来说开发起来有多难？也就是说，你在自己和潜在追求者之间设置了多少困难？ \[7\] 而且你最好对为什么你的技术难以复制有一个令人信服的解释。否则，一旦一些大公司意识到这一点，他们就会自己制造，并凭借他们的品牌、资本和分销影响力，一夜之间抢走你的市场。你就像游击队员一样，在开阔的战场上被正规军抓获。

One way to put up barriers to entry is through patents. But patents may not provide much protection. Competitors commonly find ways to work around a patent. And if they can't, they may simply violate it and invite you to sue them. A big company is not afraid to be sued; it's an everyday thing for them. They'll make sure that suing them is expensive and takes a long time. Ever heard of Philo Farnsworth? He invented television. The reason you've never heard of him is that his company was not the one to make money from it.

\[8\] The company that did was RCA, and Farnsworth's reward for his efforts was a decade of patent litigation.设立进入壁垒的一种方法是通过专利。但专利可能无法提供太多保护。竞争对手通常会想方设法绕过专利。如果他们不能，他们可能只是违反了规定并邀请您起诉他们。大公司不怕被起诉；这对他们来说是家常便饭。他们会确保起诉他们的费用昂贵且需要很长时间。听说过菲洛·法恩斯沃斯吗？他发明了电视。你从未听说过他的原因是他的公司并不是从中赚钱的公司。 \[8\] 这样做的公司是 RCA，法恩斯沃斯的努力得到的回报是十年的专利诉讼。

Here, as so often, the best defense is a good offense. If you can develop technology that's simply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don't need to rely on other defenses. Start by picking a hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice.

\[9\]在这里，正如往常一样，最好的防守就是良好的进攻。如果您能够开发出竞争对手难以复制的技术，那么您就不需要依赖其他防御措施。首先选择一个困难的问题，然后在每个决策点，采取更困难的选择。 \[9\]

**The Catch(es) 陷阱**

If it were simply a matter of working harder than an ordinary employee and getting paid proportionately, it would obviously be a good deal to start a startup. Up to a point it would be more fun. I don't think many people like the slow pace of big companies, the interminable meetings, the water-cooler conversations, the clueless middle managers, and so on.

如果只是比普通员工更加努力并获得相应报酬的问题，那么创办一家初创公司显然是一笔划算的交易。在某种程度上，这会更有趣。我想很多人都不喜欢大公司的缓慢节奏、没完没了的会议、茶余饭后的谈话、无能的中层管理人员等等。

Unfortunately there are a couple catches. One is that you can't choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit. You can't decide, for example, that you'd like to work just two or three times as hard, and get paid that much more. When you're running a startup, your competitors decide how hard you work. And they pretty much all make the same decision: as hard as you possibly can.

不幸的是，有几个问题。一是你无法选择曲线上你想要居住的点。例如，你不能决定你愿意付出两倍或三倍的努力，却能得到更多的报酬。当你经营一家初创公司时，你的竞争对手决定你的工作努力程度。他们几乎都做出了相同的决定：尽你所能。

The other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionate to your productivity. There is, as I said before, a large random multiplier in the success of any company. So in practice the deal is not that you're 30 times as productive and get paid 30 times as much. It is that you're 30 times as productive, and get paid between zero and a thousand times as much. If the mean is 30x, the median is probably zero. Most startups tank, and not just the dogfood portals we all heard about during the Internet Bubble. It's common for a startup to be developing a genuinely good product, take slightly too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.

另一个问题是，平均而言，回报仅与您的生产力成正比。正如我之前所说，任何公司的成功都有一个很大的随机乘数。因此，实际上，这并不是说您的工作效率提高了 30 倍，薪水也提高了 30 倍。也就是说，你的工作效率提高了 30 倍，而报酬却是原来的 0 到 1000 倍。如果平均值为 30 倍，则中位数可能为零。大多数初创公司都陷入困境，而不仅仅是我们在互联网泡沫期间听说过的狗粮门户网站。对于初创公司来说，开发真正好的产品、花费太长的时间、耗尽资金并不得不关闭是很常见的。

A startup is like a mosquito. A bear can absorb a hit and a crab is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing: to score. No energy is wasted on defense. The defense of mosquitos, as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little consolation to the individual mosquito.

初创公司就像一只蚊子。熊可以吸收攻击，螃蟹可以抵御攻击，但蚊子的设计目的只有一个：得分。没有在防守上浪费精力。作为一个物种，蚊子的防御在于它们的数量很多，但这对单个蚊子来说并没有什么安慰。

Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition. And you don't generally know which of the two you're going to get till the last minute. Viaweb came close to tanking several times. Our trajectory was like a sine wave. Fortunately we got bought at the top of the cycle, but it was damned close. While we were visiting Yahoo in California to talk about selling the company to them, we had to borrow a conference room to reassure an investor who was about to back out of a new round of funding that we needed to stay alive.

初创公司就像蚊子一样，往往是一个要么全有要么全无的命题。而且直到最后一刻你通常都不知道你会得到两者中的哪一个。 Viaweb 多次差点陷入困境。我们的轨迹就像正弦波。幸运的是，我们在周期的顶部被买入，但已经非常接近了。当我们访问加利福尼亚州的雅虎讨论将公司出售给他们时，我们不得不借用一间会议室来安抚即将退出我们生存所需的新一轮融资的投资者。

The all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted. Viaweb's hackers were all extremely risk-averse. If there had been some way just to work super hard and get paid for it, without having a lottery mixed in, we would have been delighted. We would have much preferred a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though theoretically the second is worth twice as much. Unfortunately, there is not currently any space in the business world where you can get the first deal.

初创公司的“全有或全无”并不是我们想要的。 Viaweb 的黑客都极度厌恶风险。如果有某种方法可以让人们超级努力地工作并获得报酬，而无需掺入彩票，我们会很高兴的。我们更倾向于 100% 的机会获得 100 万美元，而不是 20% 的机会获得 1000 万美元，尽管理论上第二个的价值是后者的两倍。不幸的是，目前商业世界中没有任何空间可以让您获得第一笔交易。

The closest you can get is by selling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside (and risk) for a smaller but guaranteed payoff. We had a chance to do this, and stupidly, as we then thought, let it slip by. After that we became comically eager to sell. For the next year or so, if anyone expressed the slightest curiosity about Viaweb we would try to sell them the company. But there were no takers, so we had to keep going.

最接近的方法是在早期阶段出售你的初创公司，放弃上涨空间（和风险）以获得较小但有保证的回报。我们本来有机会做到这一点，但正如我们当时所想的那样，我们愚蠢地错过了这个机会。从那以后，我们变得滑稽地急于出售。在接下来的一年左右的时间里，如果有人对 Viaweb 表现出一丝好奇，我们就会尝试将公司卖给他们。但没有人接受，所以我们不得不继续前进。

It would have been a bargain to buy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are not looking for bargains. A company big enough to acquire startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and within the company the people in charge of acquisitions will be among the more conservative, because they are likely to be business school types who joined the company late. They would rather overpay for a safe choice. So it is easier to sell an established startup, even at a large premium, than an early-stage one.

在早期阶段收购我们本来是很划算的，但进行收购的公司并不是在寻找便宜货。一家大到足以收购初创公司的公司就会大到足以相当保守，而公司内部负责收购的人也会更加保守，因为他们很可能是后来加入公司的商学院类型。他们宁愿多付钱来换取安全的选择。因此，出售一家成熟的初创公司比出售一家早期初创公司更容易，即使溢价很高。

**Get Users**

I think it's a good idea to get bought, if you can. Running a business is different from growing one. It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach cruising altitude. It's also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify. What would you think of a financial advisor who put all his client's assets into one volatile stock?

我认为如果可以的话，购买是个好主意。经营一家企业与发展一家企业不同。一旦达到巡航高度，让大公司接手也好。这在财务上也更明智，因为销售可以让你实现多元化。对于将客户的所有资产投入一只波动性股票的财务顾问，您有何看法？

How do you get bought? Mostly by doing the same things you'd do if you didn't intend to sell the company. Being profitable, for example. But getting bought is also an art in its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time trying to master.

你如何被收买？主要是做与你不打算出售公司时会做的事情相同的事情。例如，盈利。但被收购本身也是一门艺术，我们花了很多时间试图掌握它。

Potential buyers will always delay if they can. The hard part about getting bought is getting them to act. For most people, the most powerful motivator is not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss. For potential acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that one of their competitors will buy you. This, as we found, causes CEOs to take red-eyes. The second biggest is the worry that, if they don't buy you now, you'll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to acquire later, or even become a competitor.

如果可以的话，潜在买家总是会推迟。被收购的难点在于让他们采取行动。对于大多数人来说，最强大的动力不是对获得的希望，而是对失去的恐惧。对于潜在的收购者来说，最强大的动力是他们的竞争对手之一将收购你的前景。正如我们发现的那样，这会导致首席执行官们红眼。第二大担心是，如果他们现在不收购你，你将继续快速增长，并且以后收购的成本会更高，甚至成为竞争对手。

In both cases, what it all comes down to is users. You'd think that a company about to buy you would do a lot of research and decide for themselves how valuable your technology was. Not at all. What they go by is the number of users you have.

在这两种情况下，归根结底都是用户。您可能会认为要收购您的公司会做大量研究并自行决定您的技术有多有价值。一点也不。他们所依据的是您拥有的用户数量。

In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the best technology. And this is not as stupid as it sounds. Users are the only real proof that you've created wealth. Wealth is what people want, and if people aren't using your software, maybe it's not just because you're bad at marketing. Maybe it's because you haven't made what they want.

实际上，收购方假设客户知道谁拥有最好的技术。这并不像听起来那么愚蠢。用户是你创造财富的唯一真实证明。财富是人们想要的，如果人们不使用你的软件，也许不仅仅是因为你不擅长营销。也许是因为你没有做到他们想要的。

Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for. Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead of making users happy. In a startup, you're not just trying to solve problems. You're trying to solve problems _that users care about._

风险投资家有一系列需要警惕的危险信号。排名靠前的是一家由技术专家经营的公司，他们痴迷于解决有趣的技术问题，而不是让用户满意。在初创公司中，你不仅仅是试图解决问题。你正在努力解决用户关心的问题。

So I think you should make users the test, just as acquirers do. Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is measured by number of users. As anyone who has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement. When you try to guess where your program is slow, and what would make it faster, you almost always guess wrong.

所以我认为你应该让用户接受测试，就像收购方所做的那样。将初创公司视为优化问题，其中性能通过用户数量来衡量。任何尝试过优化软件的人都知道，关键是衡量。当你试图猜测你的程序哪里慢，什么地方让它更快时，你几乎总是猜错。

Number of users may not be the perfect test, but it will be very close. It's what acquirers care about. It's what revenues depend on. It's what makes competitors unhappy. It's what impresses reporters, and potential new users. Certainly it's a better test than your a priori notions of what problems are important to solve, no matter how technically adept you are.

用户数量可能不是完美的测试，但会非常接近。这是收购方所关心的。这就是收入所依赖的。这就是让竞争对手不高兴的原因。这就是给记者和潜在新用户留下深刻印象的地方。当然，无论您在技术上多么熟练，这都比您对需要解决的问题的先验概念更好。

Among other things, treating a startup as an optimization problem will help you avoid another pitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly-- taking a long time to develop a product. Now we can recognize this as something hackers already know to avoid: premature optimization. Get a version 1.0 out there as soon as you can. Until you have some users to measure, you're optimizing based on guesses.

除此之外，将初创公司视为优化问题将帮助您避免风投担心的另一个陷阱，这是正确的——花费很长时间来开发产品。现在我们可以认识到这是黑客已经知道要避免的事情：过早优化。尽快发布 1.0 版本。在您有一些用户可供衡量之前，您将根据猜测进行优化。

The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the underlying principle that wealth is what people want. If you plan to get rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want. So few businesses really pay attention to making customers happy. How often do you walk into a store, or call a company on the phone, with a feeling of dread in the back of your mind? When you hear "your call is important to us, please stay on the line," do you think, oh good, now everything will be all right?

这里你需要关注的是一个基本原则：财富是人们想要的。如果你打算通过创造财富致富，你就必须知道人们想要什么。很少有企业真正注重让顾客满意。您是否经常带着恐惧的心情走进一家商店，或给一家公司打电话？当您听到“您的电话对我们很重要，请保持通话”时，您是否认为，哦，太好了，现在一切都会好起来了吗？

A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner. But in technology, you cook one thing and that's what everyone eats. So any difference between what people want and what you deliver is multiplied. You please or annoy customers wholesale. The closer you can get to what they want, the more wealth you generate.

餐馆偶尔可以提供烧焦的晚餐。但在科技领域，你煮一种东西，那就是每个人都吃的东西。因此，人们想要的和你提供的之间的任何差异都会成倍增加。您批发地取悦或惹恼客户。你越接近他们想要的东西，你创造的财富就越多。

**Wealth and Power**

Making wealth is not the only way to get rich. For most of human history it has not even been the most common. Until a few centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.

创造财富并不是致富的唯一途径。在人类历史的大部分时间里，它甚至不是最常见的。直到几个世纪前，财富的主要来源是矿山、奴隶和农奴、土地和牲畜，而快速获得这些财富的唯一途径是继承、婚姻、征服或没收。财富自然是名声不好的。

Two things changed. The first was the rule of law. For most of the world's history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his henchmen would find a way to steal it. But in medieval Europe something new happened. A new class of merchants and manufacturers began to collect in towns.

\[10\] Together they were able to withstand the local feudal lord. So for the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the nerds' lunch money. This was naturally a great incentive, and possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change, industrialization.有两件事发生了变化。首先是法治。在世界历史的大部分时间里，如果你确实以某种方式积累了财富，统治者或其追随者就会想方设法窃取它。但在中世纪的欧洲发生了一些新的事情。新的商人和制造商阶层开始聚集在城镇中。 \[10\] 他们共同抵抗了当地的封建领主。因此，在我们的历史上，恶霸第一次不再偷书呆子的午餐钱。这自然是一个巨大的激励，也可能是第二次大变革——工业化的主要原因。

A great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial Revolution. But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, condition was that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace.

\[11\] One piece of evidence is what happened to countries that tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor governments of the 1960s and early 1970s. Take away the incentive of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt.关于工业革命的原因已有大量著作。但当然，一个必要的（如果不是充分的）条件是发了财的人能够平静地享受财富。 \[11\] 一个证据是那些试图回归旧模式的国家所发生的事情，例如苏联，以及较小程度上在 20 世纪 60 年代和 1970 年代初工党政府领导下的英国。失去了财富的激励，技术创新就会陷入停滞。

Remember what a startup is, economically: a way of saying, I want to work faster. Instead of accumulating money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I want to get it over with as soon as possible. So governments that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing that you work slowly. They're willing to let you earn $3 million over fifty years, but they're not willing to let you work so hard that you can do it in two. They are like the corporate boss that you can't go to and say, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times a much. Except this is not a boss you can escape by starting your own company.

请记住，从经济角度来说，初创公司是什么：一种说法，我想要更快地工作。我不想靠着五十年的固定工资来慢慢积累金钱，而是想尽快结束这一切。因此，禁止你积累财富的政府实际上是在法令你工作缓慢。他们愿意让你在五十年内赚到三百万美元，但他们不愿意让你努力工作到两年内就能完成。他们就像企业老板，你不能去找他说，我想加倍努力，所以请付给我十倍的工资。但这不是你可以通过创办自己的公司来逃避的老板。

The problem with working slowly is not just that technical innovation happens slowly. It's that it tends not to happen at all. It's only when you're deliberately looking for hard problems, as a way to use speed to the greatest advantage, that you take on this kind of project. Developing new technology is a pain in the ass. It is, as Edison said, one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it. Engineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moon rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.

缓慢工作的问题不仅仅是技术创新发生缓慢。它往往根本不会发生。只有当您刻意寻找难题并以此最大程度地利用速度时，您才会承担此类项目。开发新技术是一件很痛苦的事情。正如爱迪生所说，百分之一的灵感加上百分之九十九的汗水。没有财富的激励，没有人愿意这么做。工程师将以普通工资从事战斗机和月球火箭等性感项目，但灯泡或半导体等更平凡的技术必须由企业家开发。

Startups are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in the last couple decades. Since it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has used essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage, where measurement comes from working with a small group, and leverage from developing new techniques. The recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is in Santa Clara today.

初创企业不仅仅是过去几十年发生在硅谷的事情。自从通过创造财富致富成为可能以来，每个做到这一点的人基本上都使用相同的秘诀：衡量和杠杆，其中衡量来自与小团体的合作，杠杆来自开发新技术。 1200 年佛罗伦萨的食谱与今天圣克拉拉的食谱相同。

Understanding this may help to answer an important question: why Europe grew so powerful. Was it something about the geography of Europe? Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior? Was it their religion? The answer (or at least the proximate cause) may be that the Europeans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who made a lot of money to keep it.

了解这一点可能有助于回答一个重要问题：为什么欧洲变得如此强大。与欧洲的地理有关吗？难道欧洲人在种族上优越吗？这是他们的宗教信仰吗？答案（或者至少是直接原因）可能是欧洲人正处于一个强大的新想法的顶峰：允许那些赚了很多钱的人保留它。

Once you're allowed to do that, people who want to get rich can do it by generating wealth instead of stealing it. The resulting technological growth translates not only into wealth but into military power. The theory that led to the stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician. But because the Soviet Union didn't have a computer industry, it remained for them a theory; they didn't have hardware capable of executing the calculations fast enough to design an actual airplane.

一旦你被允许这样做，那些想致富的人就可以通过创造财富而不是窃取财富来实现这一目标。由此产生的技术增长不仅转化为财富，而且转化为军事力量。隐形飞机的理论是由一位苏联数学家提出的。但由于苏联没有计算机产业，所以这对他们来说仍然是一个理论；他们没有能够足够快地执行计算的硬件来设计一架实际的飞机。

In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as World War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history. Don't let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world.

在这方面，冷战与第二次世界大战以及近代史上的大多数战争都有同样的教训。不要让战士和政客组成的统治阶级压制企业家。使个人致富的秘诀也能使国家强大。让书呆子们保留他们的午餐钱，你就统治世界。

**Notes**

\[

1\] One valuable thing you tend to get only in startups is _uninterruptability_. Different kinds of work have different time quanta. Someone proofreading a manuscript could probably be interrupted every fifteen minutes with little loss of productivity. But the time quantum for hacking is very long: it might take an hour just to load a problem into your head. So the cost of having someone from personnel call you about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.\[1\] 只有在初创公司才能获得的一项有价值的东西是不间断性。不同种类的工作有不同的时间量。校对手稿的人可能每十五分钟就会被打断一次，而工作效率几乎没有损失。但黑客攻击的时间量非常长：仅仅将一个问题加载到你的脑海中可能就需要一个小时。因此，如果有人因您忘记填写表格而打电话给您，您的成本可能会很高。

This is why hackers give you such a baleful stare as they turn from their screen to answer your question. Inside their heads a giant house of cards is tottering.

这就是为什么黑客在离开屏幕回答你的问题时会用恶毒的目光盯着你。在他们的脑海里，一座巨大的纸牌屋正在摇摇欲坠。

The mere possibility of being interrupted deters hackers from starting hard projects. This is why they tend to work late at night, and why it's next to impossible to write great software in a cubicle (except late at night).

仅仅是被中断的可能性就阻止了黑客启动困难的项目。这就是为什么他们往往工作到深夜，也是为什么在小隔间里编写出色的软件几乎是不可能的（深夜除外）。

One great advantage of startups is that they don't yet have any of the people who interrupt you. There is no personnel department, and thus no form nor anyone to call you about it.

初创公司的一大优势是，他们还没有任何人打扰你。没有人事部门，因此没有表格或任何人可以打电话给您。

\[2\] Faced with the idea that people working for startups might be 20 or 30 times as productive as those working for large companies, executives at large companies will naturally wonder, how could I get the people working for me to do that? The answer is simple: pay them to.\[2\] 面对这样的想法：在初创公司工作的人的工作效率可能是在大公司工作的人的 20 或 30 倍，大公司的高管自然会想，我怎样才能让为我工作的人做到这一点？答案很简单：付钱给他们。

Internally most companies are run like Communist states. If you believe in free markets, why not turn your company into one?

在内部，大多数公司都像共产主义国家一样运作。如果您相信自由市场，为什么不将您的公司转变为自由市场呢？

Hypothesis: A company will be maximally profitable when each employee is paid in proportion to the wealth they generate.

假设：当每个员工的薪酬与其创造的财富成比例时，公司将实现最大利润。

\[

3\] Until recently even governments sometimes didn't grasp the distinction between money and wealth. Adam Smith (_Wealth of Nations_, v:i) mentions several that tried to preserve their "wealth" by forbidding the export of gold or silver. But having more of the medium of exchange would not make a country richer; if you have more money chasing the same amount of material wealth, the only result is higher prices.\[3\] 直到最近，甚至政府有时也没有掌握金钱和财富之间的区别。亚当·斯密（《国富论》，v:i）提到了一些试图通过禁止黄金或白银出口来保存其“财富”的人。但拥有更多的交换媒介并不会让一个国家变得更富裕；相反，如果你有更多的钱去追逐同样数量的物质财富，唯一的结果就是更高的价格。

\[

4\] There are many senses of the word "wealth," not all of them material. I'm not trying to make a deep philosophical point here about which is the true kind. I'm writing about one specific, rather technical sense of the word "wealth." What people will give you money for. This is an interesting sort of wealth to study, because it is the kind that prevents you from starving. And what people will give you money for depends on them, not you.\[4\]“财富”一词有多种含义，但并非所有含义都是物质的。我并不是想在这里提出一个深刻的哲学观点来判断哪种才是真正的。我正在写的是“财富”这个词的一种具体的、相当技术性的含义。人们会给你钱做什么。这是一种值得研究的有趣财富，因为它可以防止你挨饿。人们会给你钱做什么取决于他们，而不是你。

When you're starting a business, it's easy to slide into thinking that customers want what you do. During the Internet Bubble I talked to a woman who, because she liked the outdoors, was starting an "outdoor portal." You know what kind of business you should start if you like the outdoors? One to recover data from crashed hard disks.

当你开始创业时，很容易陷入这样的想法：客户想要你做的事情。在互联网泡沫期间，我与一位女士交谈，她因为喜欢户外活动，正在创办一个“户外门户网站”。你知道如果你喜欢户外活动，你应该开始什么样的生意吗？一种从崩溃的硬盘中恢复数据的方法。

What's the connection? None at all. Which is precisely my point. If you want to create wealth (in the narrow technical sense of not starving) then you should be especially skeptical about any plan that centers on things you like doing. That is where your idea of what's valuable is least likely to coincide with other people's.

有什么联系？一个都没有。这正是我的观点。如果你想创造财富（狭义的技术意义上的不挨饿），那么你应该对任何以你喜欢做的事情为中心的计划特别怀疑。这就是你对什么有价值的想法最不可能与其他人的想法一致的地方。

\[

5\] In the average car restoration you probably do make everyone else microscopically poorer, by doing a small amount of damage to the environment. While environmental costs should be taken into account, they don't make wealth a zero-sum game. For example, if you repair a machine that's broken because a part has come unscrewed, you create wealth with no environmental cost.\[5\] 在一般的汽车修复中，你可能会对环境造成少量破坏，从而使其他人在微观上变得更穷。虽然应该考虑环境成本，但它们并不会使财富成为零和游戏。例如，如果您修理一台因零件松动而损坏的机器，您就可以创造财富，而无需付出环境代价。

6\] Many people feel confused and depressed in their early twenties. Life seemed so much more fun in college. Well, of course it was. Don't be fooled by the surface similarities. You've gone from guest to servant. It's possible to have fun in this new world. Among other things, you now get to go behind the doors that say "authorized personnel only." But the change is a shock at first, and all the worse if you're not consciously aware of it.\[6\] 许多人在二十出头的时候就感到困惑和沮丧。大学里的生活似乎有趣多了。嗯，当然是。不要被表面的相似之处所迷惑。你已经从客人变成了仆人。在这个新世界里可以玩得开心。除其他事项外，您现在可以进入写着“仅限授权人员”的门后面。但这种变化一开始是令人震惊的，如果你没有意识到这一点，那就更糟了。

\[

7\] When VCs asked us how long it would take another startup to duplicate our software, we used to reply that they probably wouldn't be able to at all. I think this made us seem naive, or liars.\[7\] 当风险投资家问我们另一家初创公司需要多长时间才能复制我们的软件时，我们常常回答说他们可能根本做不到。我认为这让我们显得很天真，或者说是骗子。

\[

8\] Few technologies have one clear inventor. So as a rule, if you know the "inventor" of something (the telephone, the assembly line, the airplane, the light bulb, the transistor) it is because their company made money from it, and the company's PR people worked hard to spread the story. If you don't know who invented something (the automobile, the television, the computer, the jet engine, the laser), it's because other companies made all the money.\[8\] 很少有技术有一个明确的发明者。因此，通常来说，如果你知道某个东西（电话、装配线、飞机、灯泡、晶体管）的“发明者”，那是因为他们的公司从中赚钱，并且公司的公关人员努力工作传播这个故事。如果你不知道谁发明了某些东西（汽车、电视、计算机、喷气发动机、激光），那是因为其他公司赚了所有的钱。

\[

9\] This is a good plan for life in general. If you have two choices, choose the harder. If you're trying to decide whether to go out running or sit home and watch TV, go running. Probably the reason this trick works so well is that when you have two choices and one is harder, the only reason you're even considering the other is laziness. You know in the back of your mind what's the right thing to do, and this trick merely forces you to acknowledge it.\[9\] 总的来说，这是一个很好的生活计划。如果有两个选择，请选择较难的。如果您正在考虑是出去跑步还是坐在家里看电视，那就去跑步吧。也许这个技巧如此有效的原因是，当你有两种选择并且其中一种更难时，你甚至考虑另一种的唯一原因就是懒惰。你内心深处知道什么是正确的事情，而这个技巧只是迫使你承认这一点。

\[

10\] It is probably no accident that the middle class first appeared in northern Italy and the low countries, where there were no strong central governments. These two regions were the richest of their time and became the twin centers from which Renaissance civilization radiated. If they no longer play that role, it is because other places, like the United States, have been truer to the principles they discovered.\[10\] 中产阶级首先出现在意大利北部和低地国家，可能并非偶然，因为那里没有强大的中央政府。这两个地区是当时最富裕的地区，成为文艺复兴文明辐射的双中心。如果他们不再扮演这个角色，那是因为其他地方，比如美国，更加忠实于他们发现的原则。

\[

11\] It may indeed be a sufficient condition. But if so, why didn't the Industrial Revolution happen earlier? Two possible (and not incompatible) answers: (a) It did. The Industrial Revolution was one in a series. (b) Because in medieval towns, monopolies and guild regulations initially slowed the development of new means of production.\[11\]这确实可能是一个充分条件。但如果是这样，为什么工业革命没有更早发生呢？两个可能的（并非不兼容的）答案：（a）确实如此。工业革命是一系列革命中的一次。 (b)因为在中世纪城镇，垄断和行会法规最初减缓了新生产资料的发展。
