## Beating the Averages

> April 2001, rev. April 2003

- In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing. But a startup can't do what all the other startups do. I don't think a lot of people realize this, even in startups.
- If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance. The problem here is, average performance means that you'll go out of business. The survival rate for startups is way less than fifty percent. So if you're running a startup, you had better be doing something odd. If not, you're in trouble.

- In business, there is nothing more valuable than a technical advantage your competitors don't understand.
- A startup should give its competitors as little information as possible.
- The people who understood our technology best were the customers. They didn't care what language Viaweb was written in either, but they noticed that it worked really well.
- if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one.

## Taste for Makers

> February 2002

- If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tell you that "taste is subjective." They believe this because it really feels that way to them. When they like something, they have no idea why. It could be because it's beautiful, or because their mother had one, or because they saw a movie star with one in a magazine, or because they know it's expensive. Their thoughts are a tangle of unexamined impulses.
- After having been told for years that everyone just likes to do things their own way, he is unlikely to head straight for the conclusion that a great artist is someone whose work is *better* than the others'. A far more likely theory, in his Ptolemaic model of the universe, is that a great artist is something that's good for you, like broccoli, because someone said so in a book.
- Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good way to prevent disputes. The trouble is, it's not true. You feel this when you start to design things.
- **Good design is simple.** 
- For architects and designers it means that beauty should depend on a few carefully chosen structural elements rather than a profusion of superficial ornament. (Ornament is not in itself bad, only when it's camouflage on insipid form.)
- In writing it means: say what you mean and say it briefly.
- When you're forced to be simple, you're forced to face the real problem. When you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.当你被迫变得简单时，你就被迫面对真正的问题。当你无法提供装饰时，你必须提供实质内容。
- **Good design is timeless.**
- Aiming at timelessness is a way to make yourself find the best answer: if you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself. Some of the greatest masters did this so well that they left little room for those who came after. Every engraver since Durer has had to live in his shadow.追求永恒是让自己找到最佳答案的一种方式：如果你能想象有人超越你，你就应该自己去做。一些最伟大的大师在这方面做得非常好，以至于他们为后继者留下了很少的空间。自丢勒以来的每一位雕刻家都不得不生活在他的阴影下。
- Aiming at timelessness is also a way to evade the grip of fashion. Fashions almost by definition change with time, so if you can make something that will still look good far into the future, then its appeal must derive more from merit and less from fashion.追求永恒也是逃避时尚束缚的一种方式。时尚几乎从定义上来说会随着时间而变化，所以如果你能做出一些在遥远的未来仍然好看的东西，那么它的吸引力一定更多地来自于优点，而不是来自时尚。
- Strangely enough, if you want to make something that will appeal to future generations, one way to do it is to try to appeal to past generations. It's hard to guess what the future will be like, but we can be sure it will be like the past in caring nothing for present fashions. So if you can make something that appeals to people today and would also have appealed to people in 1500, there is a good chance it will appeal to people in 2500.奇怪的是，如果你想做一些能够吸引后代的东西，一种方法就是尝试吸引过去的几代人。很难猜测未来会是什么样子，但我们可以肯定，它会像过去一样，不关心现在的时尚。因此，如果你能制作出既能吸引今天的人们，又能吸引 1500 年的人们的东西，那么它很有可能会吸引 2500 年的人们。
- **Good design solves the right problem.**
- A lot of bad design is industrious, but misguided.
- **Good design is suggestive.** 
- 好的设计是有启发性的
- In software, it means you should give users a few basic elements that they can combine as they wish, like Lego.
- **Good design is often slightly funny.** 
- I think it's because humor is related to strength. To have a sense of humor is to be strong: to keep one's sense of humor is to shrug off misfortunes, and to lose one's sense of humor is to be wounded by them. And so the mark-- or at least the prerogative-- of strength is not to take oneself too seriously. The confident will often, like swallows, seem to be making fun of the whole process slightly, as Hitchcock does in his films or Bruegel in his paintings-- or Shakespeare, for that matter.我认为这是因为幽默与力量有关。有幽默感就是坚强：保持幽默感就是对不幸不屑一顾，失去幽默感就是被不幸所伤害。因此，力量的标志——或者至少是特权——就是不要太认真地对待自己。自信的人往往会像燕子一样，似乎对整个过程稍稍取笑，就像希区柯克在他的电影中所做的那样，或者勃鲁盖尔在他的画作中所做的那样，或者莎士比亚那样。
- Good design may not have to be funny, but it's hard to imagine something that could be called humorless also being good design.好的设计可能不一定是有趣的，但很难想象一些可以被称为无幽默感的东西也是好的设计。
- **Good design is hard.** 
- When you have to climb a mountain you toss everything unnecessary out of your pack. And so an architect who has to build on a difficult site, or a small budget, will find that he is forced to produce an elegant design. Fashions and flourishes get knocked aside by the difficult business of solving the problem at all.当你必须爬山时，你会从背包里扔掉所有不必要的东西。因此，一位必须在困难的地点或预算很少的地方建造的建筑师会发现他被迫做出优雅的设计。时尚和繁荣都被解决问题的艰巨任务所抛弃。
- **Good design looks easy.** 
- In most fields the appearance of ease seems to come with practice. Perhaps what practice does is train your unconscious mind to handle tasks that used to require conscious thought. In some cases you literally train your body. An expert pianist can play notes faster than the brain can send signals to his hand. Likewise an artist, after a while, can make visual perception flow in through his eye and out through his hand as automatically as someone tapping his foot to a beat.在大多数领域，看似轻松似乎都是通过练习来实现的。也许练习的作用是训练你的无意识思维来处理过去需要有意识思考的任务。在某些情况下，你实际上是在训练你的身体。专业钢琴家弹奏音符的速度比大脑向他的手发送信号的速度还要快。同样，艺术家在一段时间后可以让视觉感知通过他的眼睛流入并通过他的手流出，就像有人随着节拍敲击脚一样自动。
- **Good design uses symmetry.**
- I think symmetry may just be one way to achieve simplicity, but it's important enough to be mentioned on its own. Nature uses it a lot, which is a good sign.好的设计利用对称性。我认为对称可能只是实现简单性的一种方式，但它的重要性足以单独提及。大自然经常使用它，这是一个好兆头。
- There are two kinds of symmetry, repetition and recursion. Recursion means repetition in subelements, like the pattern of veins in a leaf.对称有两种，重复和递归。递归意味着子元素的重复，就像叶子中的静脉图案一样。
- Symmetry is unfashionable in some fields now, in reaction to excesses in the past. Architects started consciously making buildings asymmetric in Victorian times and by the 1920s asymmetry was an explicit premise of modernist architecture. Even these buildings only tended to be asymmetric about major axes, though; there were hundreds of minor symmetries.由于过去的过度行为，对称性现在在某些领域已经不流行了。在维多利亚时代，建筑师开始有意识地使建筑物不对称，到了 1920 年代，不对称已成为现代主义建筑的明确前提。然而，即使是这些建筑物也只是关于主轴线不对称。有数百个小对称性。
- In writing you find symmetry at every level, from the phrases in a sentence to the plot of a novel. You find the same in music and art. Mosaics (and some Cezannes) get extra visual punch by making the whole picture out of the same atoms. Compositional symmetry yields some of the most memorable paintings, especially when two halves react to one another, as in the *[Creation of Adam](https://paulgraham.com/symptg.html)* or *[American Gothic](https://paulgraham.com/symptg.html).*在写作中，从句子中的短语到小说的情节，你会发现各个层面上的对称性。你在音乐和艺术中也会发现同样的情况。马赛克（和一些塞尚）通过用相同的原子制作整个图片而获得额外的视觉冲击力。构图对称产生了一些最令人难忘的画作，尤其是当两个半体相互反应时，例如《创造亚当》或《美国哥特式》。
- In math and engineering, recursion, especially, is a big win. Inductive proofs are wonderfully short. In software, a problem that can be solved by recursion is nearly always best solved that way. The Eiffel Tower looks striking partly because it is a recursive solution, a tower on a tower.在数学和工程领域，递归尤其是一个巨大的胜利。归纳证明非常简短。在软件中，可以通过递归解决的问题几乎总是以这种方式得到最好的解决。埃菲尔铁塔看起来引人注目，部分原因是它是一个递归解决方案，是塔上的塔。
- The danger of symmetry, and repetition especially, is that it can be used as a substitute for thought.对称性，尤其是重复性的危险在于，它可以被用作思想的替代品。
