# How To Be Successful 如何成功

[blog.samaltman.com](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)

I’ve observed thousands of founders and thought a lot about what it takes to make a huge amount of money or to create something important. Usually, people start off wanting the former and end up wanting the latter.我观察了数以千计的创始人，并思考了如何才能赚到巨额资金或创造出重要的东西。通常，人们开始想要前者，最终想要后者。

Here are 13 thoughts about how to achieve such outlier success. Everything here is easier to do once you’ve already reached a baseline degree of success (through privilege or effort) and want to put in the work to turn that into outlier success. \[1\] But much of it applies to anyone.以下是关于如何取得如此非凡成功的 13 条想法。一旦你已经达到了一定程度的成功（通过特权或努力），并且想要付出努力将其转化为非凡的成功，那么这里的一切都会变得更容易。 \[1\] 但其中大部分内容适用于任何人。

**1\. Compound yourself 1.复合自己**

Compounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation.复合是魔法。到处寻找它。指数曲线是财富创造的关键。

A medium-sized business that grows 50% in value every year becomes huge in a very short amount of time. Few businesses in the world have true network effects and extreme scalability. But with technology, more and more will. It’s worth a lot of effort to find them and create them.每年价值增长 50% 的中型企业在很短的时间内就变得庞大。世界上很少有企业拥有真正的网络效应和极高的可扩展性。但随着技术的发展，越来越多的人会这样做。找到它们并创造它们是值得付出很多努力的。

You also want to be an exponential curve yourself—you should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. It’s important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect—most careers progress fairly linearly.你也希望自己成为一条指数曲线——你的目标应该是让你的生活遵循一条不断增长的正确轨迹。走向具有复合效应的职业非常重要——大多数职业的进展相当线性。

You don't want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twenty—your rate of learning should always be high. As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. There are many ways to get this leverage, such as capital, technology, brand, network effects, and managing people.你不想从事这样一种职业：干了两年的人就可以像干了二十年的人一样高效——你的学习率应该始终很高。随着你职业生涯的进步，你所做的每个工作单元都应该产生越来越多的成果。获得这种影响力的方法有很多，比如资本、技术、品牌、网络效应、人员管理等。

It’s useful to focus on adding another zero to whatever you define as your success metric—money, status, impact on the world, or whatever. I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.专注于在你定义的成功指标上再加一个零是很有用的——金钱、地位、对世界的影响等等。我愿意在项目之间花尽可能多的时间来寻找我的下一个目标。但我一直希望它是一个项目，如果成功的话，将使我余下的职业生涯看起来像一个脚注。

Most people get bogged down in linear opportunities. Be willing to let small opportunities go to focus on potential step changes.大多数人都会陷入线性机会的泥潭。愿意放弃小机会，专注于潜在的步骤变化。

I think the biggest competitive advantage in business—either for a company or for an individual’s career—is long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together. One of the notable aspects of compound growth is that the furthest out years are the most important. In a world where almost no one takes a truly long-term view, the market richly rewards those who do.我认为，无论是对于公司还是个人的职业生涯来说，商业中最大的竞争优势是对世界上不同系统如何整合的广泛视野进行长期思考。复合增长的一个值得注意的方面是，最远的年份是最重要的。在一个几乎没有人真正具有长远眼光的世界里，市场会丰厚地奖励那些真正具有长远眼光的人。

Trust the exponential, be patient, and be pleasantly surprised.相信指数，保持耐心，你就会得到惊喜。

**2\. Have almost too much self-belief2\. 过于自信**

Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion.自信的力量是非常强大的。我认识的最成功的人对自己的信任几乎达到了妄想的程度。

Cultivate this early. As you get more data points that your judgment is good and you can consistently deliver results, trust yourself more.早点培养这个吧。当您获得更多数据点表明您的判断是正确的并且您可以始终如一地交付结果时，请更加相信自己。

If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created.如果你不相信自己，就很难让自己对未来有逆向想法。但这是创造大部分价值的地方。

I remember when Elon Musk took me on a tour of the SpaceX factory many years ago. He talked in detail about manufacturing every part of the rocket, but the thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars. I left thinking “huh, so that’s the benchmark for what conviction looks like.”我记得很多年前埃隆·马斯克带我参观了 SpaceX 工厂。他详细谈论了火箭每个部件的制造过程，但令人印象深刻的是当他谈论向火星发送大型火箭时，他脸上绝对确定的表情。我离开时想：“嗯，这就是信念的基准。”

Managing your own morale—and your team’s morale—is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. It’s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.管理自己和团队的士气是大多数努力中最大的挑战之一。如果没有足够的自信，这几乎是不可能的。不幸的是，你越有野心，世界就越会试图摧毁你。

Most highly successful people have been really right about the future at least once at a time when people thought they were wrong. If not, they would have faced much more competition.大多数非常成功的人至少有一次对未来的看法是正确的，而人们却认为他们是错误的。如果不是，他们将面临更多的竞争。

Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. I used to hate criticism of any sort and actively avoided it. Now I try to always listen to it with the assumption that it’s true, and then decide if I want to act on it or not. Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion.自信必须与自我意识相平衡。我曾经讨厌任何形式的批评并积极避免它。现在，我总是尝试着假设它是真的来倾听它，然后决定是否要采取行动。寻求真理是困难的，而且常常是痛苦的，但正是它区分了自信和自欺欺人。

This balance also helps you avoid coming across as entitled and out of touch.这种平衡还可以帮助您避免给人留下有权有势和脱离现实的印象。

**3\. Learn to think independently3.学会独立思考**

Entrepreneurship is very difficult to teach because original thinking is very difficult to teach. School is not set up to teach this—in fact, it generally rewards the opposite. So you have to cultivate it on your own.创业精神很难教，因为原创思维很难教。学校的设立并不是为了教授这一点——事实上，它通常奖励相反的东西。所以你必须自己去培养它。

Thinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas is fun, and finding people to exchange them with is a great way to get better at this. The next step is to find easy, fast ways to test these ideas in the real world.从基本原理出发思考并尝试产生新的想法很有趣，而找到可以交流想法的人是在这方面做得更好的好方法。下一步是找到简单、快速的方法来在现实世界中测试这些想法。

“I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky.“我会失败很多次，但我会真正正确一次”，这是创业者的方式。你必须给自己很多幸运的机会。

One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. The more times you do this, the more you will believe it. Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down.值得学习的最有力的教训之一是，您可以弄清楚在似乎没有解决方案的情况下该怎么做。你这样做的次数越多，你就越相信它。勇气来自于知道你可以在被击倒后重新站起来。

**4\. Get good at “sales”4、善于“销售”**

Self-belief alone is not sufficient—you also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe.仅有自信是不够的——你还必须能够让其他人相信你的信念。

All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. You have to evangelize your plans to customers, prospective employees, the press, investors, etc. This requires an inspiring vision, strong communication skills, some degree of charisma, and evidence of execution ability.在某种程度上，所有伟大的职业都会成为销售工作。你必须向客户、潜在员工、媒体、投资者等宣传你的计划。这需要鼓舞人心的愿景、强大的沟通技巧、一定程度的魅力以及执行能力的证据。

Getting good at communication—particularly written communication—is an investment worth making. My best advice for communicating clearly is to first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language.善于沟通——尤其是书面沟通——是一项值得投资。对于清晰沟通，我的最佳建议是首先确保您的想法清晰，然后使用简单、简洁的语言。

The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you’re selling. Selling what you truly believe in feels great, and trying to sell snake oil feels awful.擅长销售的最好方法是真诚地相信你所销售的产品。出售你真正相信的东西感觉很棒，而试图出售万金油感觉很糟糕。

Getting good at sales is like improving at any other skill—anyone can get better at it with deliberate practice. But for some reason, perhaps because it feels distasteful, many people treat it as something unlearnable.擅长销售就像提高任何其他技能一样——任何人都可以通过刻意练习来变得更好。但出于某种原因，也许是因为感觉令人厌恶，许多人将其视为无法学习的东西。

My other big sales tip is to show up in person whenever it’s important. When I was first starting out, I was always willing to get on a plane. It was frequently unnecessary, but three times it led to career-making turning points for me that otherwise would have gone the other way.我的另一个重要销售技巧是在重要的时候亲自出现。当我刚开始的时候，我总是愿意坐飞机。这通常是不必要的，但有三次它给我带来了职业生涯的转折点，否则我的职业生涯就会走向另一条路。

**5\. Make it easy to take risks5.让冒险变得容易**

Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time—you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more.大多数人高估了风险，低估了回报。承担风险很重要，因为不可能一直都是正确的——你必须尝试很多事情，并随着了解更多而快速适应。

It’s often easier to take risks early in your career; you don’t have much to lose, and you potentially have a lot to gain. Once you’ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction.在职业生涯早期承担风险通常更容易；你并没有什么可失去的，而且你可能会得到很多。一旦你已经履行了基本义务，你就应该尝试让自己更容易承担风险。寻找一些小赌注，如果你错了，你会输掉 1 倍，但如果成功的话，你会输 100 倍。然后朝那个方向下更大的赌注。

Don’t save up for too long, though. At YC, we’ve often noticed a problem with founders that have spent a lot of time working at Google or Facebook. When people get used to a comfortable life, a predictable job, and a reputation of succeeding at whatever they do, it gets very hard to leave that behind (and people have an incredible ability to always match their lifestyle to next year’s salary). Even if they do leave, the temptation to return is great. It’s easy—and human nature—to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term fulfillment.不过，不要存太久。在 YC，我们经常注意到那些在 Google 或 Facebook 工作过很长时间的创始人存在的问题。当人们习惯了舒适的生活、可预测的工作以及无论做什么都会成功的声誉时，就很难将其抛在脑后（而且人们有一种令人难以置信的能力，能够始终将自己的生活方式与明年的薪水相匹配）。即使他们真的离开了，回来的诱惑也很大。优先考虑短期收益和便利而不是长期满足是很容易的，也是人的本性。

But when you aren’t on the treadmill, you can follow your hunches and spend time on things that might turn out to be really interesting. Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way to do this, but obviously comes with tradeoffs.但是，当您不在跑步机上时，您可以跟随自己的直觉，花时间做一些可能会变得非常有趣的事情。尽可能长时间地保持生活廉价和灵活是实现这一目标的有效方法，但显然需要权衡。

**6\. Focus 6\. 专注**

Focus is a force multiplier on work.专注是工作的力量倍增器。

Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.几乎我遇到的每个人都会因为花更多的时间思考应该关注什么而受益匪浅。做正确的事情比长时间工作更重要。大多数人把大部分时间浪费在无关紧要的事情上。

Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.一旦你弄清楚要做什么，就势不可挡地快速完成你的一小部分优先事项。我还没有遇到过一个行动缓慢但却非常成功的人。

**7\. Work hard 7\. 努力工作**

You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both—you will be competing with other very talented people who will have great ideas and be willing to work a lot.通过聪明或努力工作，你可以达到你所在领域的第 90% 左右，这仍然是一项伟大的成就。但要达到第 99 个百分位，两者都需要——你将与其他非常有才华的人竞争，他们有伟大的想法并且愿意付出很多努力。

Extreme people get extreme results. Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs, and it’s perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of advantages. As in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success.极端的人会得到极端的结果。大量工作会带来巨大的生活权衡，决定不这样做是完全理性的。但它有很多优点。与大多数情况一样，势头会复合，成功会带来成功。

And it’s often really fun. One of the great joys in life is finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself. A YC founder recently expressed great surprise about how much happier and more fulfilled he was after leaving his job at a big company and working towards his maximum possible impact. Working hard at that should be celebrated.这通常非常有趣。生活中最大的乐趣之一就是找到你的目标，并在其中表现出色，并发现你的影响力对比你自己更重要的事物很重要。一位 YC 创始人最近表示，在辞去一家大公司的工作并努力实现最大可能的影响后，他感到更加快乐和满足，这让他感到非常惊讶。在这方面的努力应该值得庆祝。

It’s not entirely clear to me why working hard has become a Bad Thing in certain parts of the US, but this is certainly not the case in other parts of the world—the amount of energy and drive exhibited by entrepreneurs outside of the US is quickly becoming the new benchmark.我并不完全清楚为什么努力工作在美国某些地区变成了一件坏事，但在世界其他地区情况肯定不是这样——美国以外的企业家所表现出的精力和动力很快就消失了。成为新的标杆。

You have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. People find their own strategies for this, but one that almost always works is to find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with.你必须弄清楚如何努力工作而不精疲力竭。人们为此找到了自己的策略，但几乎总是有效的策略是找到你喜欢和你喜欢花很多时间在一起的人一起做的工作。

I think people who pretend you can be super successful professionally without working most of the time (for some period of your life) are doing a disservice. In fact, work stamina seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success.我认为那些假装你可以在职业上取得超级成功而无需大部分时间（在你生命中的某个时期）工作的人是在伤害你。事实上，工作耐力似乎是长期成功的最大预测因素之一。

One more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career. Hard work compounds like interest, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have for the benefits to pay off. It’s also easier to work hard when you have fewer other responsibilities, which is frequently but not always the case when you’re young.关于努力工作的另一个想法是：在职业生涯的一开始就这样做。努力工作就像利息一样，越早开始，就有越多的时间获得回报。当你承担的其他责任较少时，你也会更容易努力工作，这种情况在你年轻时经常出现，但并不总是如此。

**8\. Be bold 8\. 大胆**

I believe that it’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters.我相信艰难的创业比简单的创业更容易。人们希望成为令人兴奋的事情的一部分，并觉得他们的工作很重要。

If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you. Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on.如果你在一个重要问题上取得进展，就会有源源不断的人愿意帮助你。让自己变得更加雄心勃勃，不要害怕做你真正想做的事情。

If everyone else is starting meme companies, and you want to start a gene-editing company, then do that and don’t second guess it.如果其他人都在创办模因公司，而你想创办一家基因编辑公司，那就去做吧，不要事后猜测。

Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.跟随你的好奇心。对你来说令人兴奋的事情对其他人来说通常也会令人兴奋。

**9\. Be willful 9\. 任性**

A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are.一个大秘密是，你可以在令人惊讶的比例下让世界屈服于你的意志——大多数人甚至不去尝试，只是接受事情本来的样子。

People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.人们拥有使事情发生的巨大能力。自我怀疑、过早放弃以及不够努力，这些因素综合在一起，阻碍了大多数人发挥自己的潜力。

Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well.询问你想要什么。你通常不会得到它，而且拒绝往往会很痛苦。但当这个方法发挥作用时，效果却出奇的好。

Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.几乎总是，那些说“我将继续前进，直到成功为止，无论面临什么挑战，我都会解决它们”的人，并且是认真的，继续走向成功。他们坚持不懈，足以给自己带来幸运的机会。

Airbnb is my benchmark for this. There are so many stories they tell that I wouldn’t recommend trying to reproduce (keeping maxed-out credit cards in those nine-slot three-ring binder pages kids use for baseball cards, eating dollar store cereal for every meal, battle after battle with powerful entrenched interest, and on and on) but they managed to survive long enough for luck to go their way.Airbnb 是我的标杆。他们讲述的故事太多了，我不建议尝试复制（将用完的信用卡放在孩子们用来做棒球卡的九槽三环活页夹页面中，每顿饭都吃美元商店的麦片，一场又一场的战斗凭借强大的根深蒂固的兴趣，等等），但他们设法生存了足够长的时间，幸运的是他们。

To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.要想任性，就必须乐观——希望这是一种可以通过练习来改善的人格特质。我从来没有遇到过一个非常成功的悲观主义者。

**10\. Be hard to compete with10\. 难以与之竞争**

Most people understand that companies are more valuable if they are difficult to compete with. This is important, and obviously true.大多数人都知道，如果公司难以与之竞争，那么它们就更有价值。这很重要，而且显然是正确的。

But this holds true for you as an individual as well. If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money.但这对于你个人来说也同样适用。如果你所做的事情可以由其他人完成，那么最终就会实现，而且成本会更少。

The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it.变得难以竞争的最好方法是建立影响力。例如，您可以通过人际关系、建立强大的个人品牌或擅长多个不同领域的交叉点来做到这一点。还有很多其他策略，但你必须找到一些方法来实现。

Most people do whatever most people they hang out with do. This mimetic behavior is usually a mistake—if you’re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with.大多数人都会做与他们一起出去玩的大多数人所做的事情。这种模仿行为通常是一个错误——如果你和其他人做同样的事情，那么你就不难与别人竞争。

**11\. Build a network 11.建立网络**

Great work requires teams. Developing a network of talented people to work with—sometimes closely, sometimes loosely—is an essential part of a great career. The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish.伟大的工作需要团队。建立一个由人才组成的网络来共事——有时是密切的，有时是松散的——是伟大职业生涯的重要组成部分。你所认识的真正有才华的人的网络规模往往会成为你所能完成的事情的限制因素。

An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. Doing this, over a long period of time, is what lead to most of my best career opportunities and three of my four best investments. I’m continually surprised how often something good happens to me because of something I did to help a founder ten years ago.建立人际网络的一个有效方法是尽可能地帮助人们。在很长一段时间内，这样做是我获得大部分最佳职业机会和四项最佳投资中的三项的原因。我一直感到惊讶的是，由于十年前我为帮助一位创始人所做的事情，好事经常发生在我身上。

One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come back to you 10x. Also, learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles. (This is the most important thing I have learned about management, and I haven’t read much about it.) You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out.建立人际网络的最佳方法之一就是建立真正关心与你一起工作的人的声誉。分享好处时过于慷慨；它会以 10 倍的速度返回给你。此外，还要学习如何评估人们擅长的领域，并将他们安排在这些岗位上。 （这是我学到的关于管理的最重要的事情，我没有读过太多相关内容。）你希望获得这样的声誉：对人们施加足够的压力，让他们取得比他们想象的更多的成就，但又不要太用力，以至于他们无法做到。烧完。

Everyone is better at some things than others. Define yourself by your strengths, not your weaknesses. Acknowledge your weaknesses and figure out how to work around them, but don’t let them stop you from doing what you want to do. “I can’t do X because I’m not good at Y” is something I hear from entrepreneurs surprisingly often, and almost always reflects a lack of creativity. The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are.每个人在某些事情上都比其他事情更好。根据你的优势而不是劣势来定义你自己。承认自己的弱点并找出解决方法，但不要让它们阻止你做你想做的事。令人惊讶的是，我经常从企业家那里听到“我不能做 X，因为我不擅长 Y”，而且几乎总是反映出缺乏创造力。弥补你的弱点的最好方法是雇佣互补的团队成员，而不是仅仅雇佣那些擅长与你相同的事情的人。

A particularly valuable part of building a network is to get good at discovering undiscovered talent. Quickly spotting intelligence, drive, and creativity gets much easier with practice. The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesn’t. Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of improvement, and don’t overvalue experience or current accomplishment.建立网络的一个特别有价值的部分是善于发现未被发现的人才。通过练习，快速发现智力、动力和创造力会变得更加容易。最简单的学习方法就是结识很多人，并记录谁给你留下了深刻的印象，谁没有给你留下深刻的印象。请记住，您主要关注的是改进率，不要高估经验或当前的成就。

I try to always ask myself when I meet someone new “is this person a force of nature?” It’s a pretty good heuristic for finding people who are likely to accomplish great things.当我遇到新朋友时，我总是试着问自己“这个人是天生的力量吗？”对于寻找可能成就伟大事业的人来说，这是一个非常好的启发法。

A special case of developing a network is finding someone eminent to take a bet on you, ideally early in your career. The best way to do this, no surprise, is to go out of your way to be helpful. (And remember that you have to pay this forward at some point later!)建立人际网络的一个特殊情况是找到一位杰出人士来对你下注，最好是在你职业生涯的早期。毫不奇怪，做到这一点的最好方法就是竭尽全力提供帮助。 （请记住，您必须在稍后的某个时候支付这笔费用！）

Finally, remember to spend your time with positive people who support your ambitions.最后，请记住与支持您的抱负的积极的人共度时光。

**12\. You get rich by owning things12.拥有东西就能致富**

The biggest economic misunderstanding of my childhood was that people got rich from high salaries. Though there are some exceptions—entertainers for example —almost no one in the history of the Forbes list has gotten there with a salary.我童年时期最大的经济误解是人们靠高薪致富。尽管也有一些例外（例如艺人），但在福布斯排行榜的历史上，几乎没有人是靠薪水进入这一榜单的。

You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value.通过拥有快速增值的东西，你会变得真正富有。

This can be a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or other similar things. But somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly.这可以是企业、房地产、自然资源、知识产权或其他类似事物的一部分。但不知何故，你需要拥有某物的股权，而不是仅仅出售你的时间。时间只线性缩放。

The best way to make things that increase rapidly in value is by making things people want at scale.制造价值快速增值的最佳方法是大规模制造人们想要的东西。

**13\. Be internally driven 13\. 内部驱动**

Most people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to impress other people. This is bad for many reasons, but here are two important ones.大多数人主要是受外部驱动的；他们做他们所做的事情是因为他们想给别人留下深刻的印象。这很糟糕，原因有很多，但有两个重要的原因。

First, you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks. You will care a lot—much more than you realize—if other people think you’re doing the right thing. This will probably prevent you from doing truly interesting work, and even if you do, someone else would have done it anyway.首先，您将致力于达成共识的想法和共识的职业道路。如果其他人认为你做的是正确的事，你会非常关心——比你意识到的要多得多。这可能会阻止你做真正有趣的工作，即使你做了，别人也会做的。

Second, you will usually get risk calculations wrong. You’ll be very focused on keeping up with other people and not falling behind in competitive games, even in the short term.其次，你通常会错误地计算风险。即使在短期内，你也会非常专注于跟上其他人的步伐，不要在竞争性游戏中落后。

Smart people seem to be especially at risk of such externally-driven behavior. Being aware of it helps, but only a little—you will likely have to work super-hard to not fall in the mimetic trap.聪明人似乎尤其容易出现这种由外部驱动的行为。意识到这一点会有所帮助，但只有一点点——你可能必须非常努力才能不落入模仿陷阱。

The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. After you’ve made enough money to buy whatever you want and gotten enough social status that it stops being fun to get more, this is the only force I know of that will continue to drive you to higher levels of performance.我认识的最成功的人主要是内部驱动的。他们做事是为了给自己留下深刻印象，因为他们觉得有必要让世界发生一些事情。当你赚了足够的钱来购买你想要的任何东西并获得足够的社会地位之后，获得更多的钱就不再有趣，这是我所知道的唯一会继续推动你达到更高水平的表现的力量。

This is why the question of a person’s motivation is so important. It’s the first thing I try to understand about someone. The right motivations are hard to define a set of rules for, but you know it when you see it.这就是为什么一个人的动机问题如此重要。这是我尝试了解某人的第一件事。正确的动机很难定义一套规则，但当你看到它时你就知道了。

Jessica Livingston and Paul Graham are my benchmarks for this. YC was widely mocked for the first few years, and almost no one thought it would be a big success when they first started. But they thought it would be great for the world if it worked, and they love helping people, and they were convinced their new model was better than the existing model.杰西卡·利文斯顿和保罗·格雷厄姆是我的基准。 YC 在最初的几年里受到了广泛的嘲笑，几乎没有人在刚开始的时候认为它会取得巨大的成功。但他们认为，如果它有效的话，这对世界来说将是伟大的，而且他们喜欢帮助人们，并且确信他们的新模式比现有模式更好。

Eventually, you will define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are important to you. The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able to go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren’t obsessed with.最终，您将通过在对您重要的领域中出色的工作来定义您的成功。你越早朝这个方向出发，你就能走得越远。任何你不痴迷的事情都很难取得巨大成功。

\[1\] A comment response I wrote on HN:\[1\] 我在HN上写的评论回复：

One of the biggest reasons I'm excited about basic income is the amount of human potential it will unleash by freeing more people to take risks.我对基本收入感到兴奋的最大原因之一是，它将通过让更多的人自由地承担风险来释放人类的潜力。

Until then, if you aren't born lucky, you have to claw your way up for awhile before you can take big swings. If you are born in extreme poverty, then this is super difficult :(在那之前，如果你不是天生幸运，你就必须努力奋斗一段时间，然后才能采取重大行动。如果你出生在极端贫困中，那么这是非常困难的:(

It is obviously an incredible shame and waste that opportunity is so unevenly distributed. But I've witnessed enough people be born with the deck stacked badly against them and go on to incredible success to know it's possible.机会分布如此不均，这显然是一种令人难以置信的耻辱和浪费。但我亲眼目睹了足够多的人出生时就处于不利的境地，但后来取得了令人难以置信的成功，知道这是可能的。

I am deeply aware of the fact that I personally would not be where I am if I weren't born incredibly lucky.我深深地意识到，如果我不是出生得非常幸运，我个人就不会取得今天的成就。
