## Part2 Deal Selection



### 2.1负面清单筛选

#### 2.1.1 *Breach of an investment mandate*.不要风格漂移

- 关于[investment mandate]([什么是投资授权？ — 约查 --- What Is An Investment Mandate? — Yochaa](https://yochaa.com/what-is-an-investment-mandate))的解释。Be disciplined about sticking to your investment mandate exactly in terms of **investment stage, deal structure, sector and geography**.  risk tolerance 投资阶段、交易结构、行业和地域

#### 2.1.2 *Challenging geography*. 地区因素

- 关于地理因素有几个考虑要点：

> weak corporate governance practices, inadequate legal systems and underdeveloped capital markets

#### 2.1.3 令人担忧的行业

- 行业至少在**未来10-15年**有较好的前景，为什么需要这么长？Why? Apart from supporting your own investment thesis, there should be plenty of room for another investor, who will be buying the company from you at exit, to construct a viable investment thesis 5–7 years down the line。因为你需要在你退出的时候仍有人愿意来接盘。 Ronald Cohen有一本书[The Second Bounce Of The Ball]([The Second Bounce Of The Ball: Turning Risk Into Opportunity: Cohen, Ronald: 9780753824368: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Second-Bounce-Ball-Turning-Opportunity/dp/0753824361/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1E1UZ70CY8515&keywords=the+second+bounce+of+the+ball&qid=1705291246&sprefix=the+second+bounce+of+the+ball%2Caps%2C1370&sr=8-1)) .

- 避开那些结构特征不佳、没有定价权、进入门槛低或你怀疑可能会永久衰退的行业。
- 避开任何你认为可能保持小规模或服务于高度特定客户的行业avoid any industry that you believe is likely to remain small or serve a highly specific niche of customers

#### 2.1.4 拒绝小额投资

- making investments that are too small is a highly inefficient use of my fund's financial and human capital. 小额投资的交易成本（律师、财务尽调费用)和监督成本同样很高。

#### 2.1.5 之前投资失败过的行业

> Even if you believe that your firm has fully digested the lossmaking event and fully learned from its mistakes, stay away from similar deals. Your fund's investment committee will probably be highly allergic to spending any time on anything reminiscent of an earlier investment embarrassment. There are probably quite a few investment professionals who had to spend many exasperating hours on irksome conversations with LPs explaining what went wrong in a bad deal. Since nobody in the fund will be in any rush to relive this experience, **it is probably a good decision to drop any deals that will bring back bad memories**

#### 2.1.6 最好做控股投资者
